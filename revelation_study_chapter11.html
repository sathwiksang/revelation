                <h2>Context:</h2>
                <p>
                    Revelation 11 continues the Apostle John's vision of the "things which shall be hereafter" (Rev. 4:1).
                    Most futurist interpreters including Plymouth Brethren theologians understand chapters 4-19 to
                    describe the future Great Tribulation period, after the Church has been raptured (caught up to heaven)
                    <sup>1</sup>. In this view, God's prophetic focus has shifted back to Israel and the nations for the final seven years
                    before Christ's return, often identified with the 70th week of Daniel (Daniel 9:27). Chapter 11 specifically
                    introduces two key prophetic events: the measuring of a temple in Jerusalem and the ministry of God's Two
                    Witnesses, culminating in the sounding of the Seventh Trumpet. We will examine the chapter verse by
                    verse, highlighting doctrinal significance, parallel Scriptures, and practical applications for personal faith.
                </p>

                <h2>Verses 1-2: Measuring the Temple and the Holy City</h2>
                <p>
                    "Then I was given a reed like a measuring rod. And the angel stood, saying, 'Rise and measure the
                    temple of God, the altar, and those who worship there. But leave out the court which is outside the
                    temple, and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles. And they will tread the holy city
                    underfoot for forty-two months." (Rev. 11:1-2, NKJV)
                </p>
                <p>
                    John is instructed to measure the temple in his vision. In Scripture, when God "measures" something, it
                    often signifies His ownership, evaluation, or protection of it <sup>2 3</sup>. Here the act of measuring implies God
                    is marking out a place and a people in Jerusalem as belonging to Him, even during the Tribulation. This
                    temple is understood as a future rebuilt temple in Jerusalem during the last days <sup>4</sup>. The scene "clearly
                    involves Jerusalem and the future temple in the last days" <sup>4</sup>, indicating that by this point in prophecy,
                    Israel has been restored to their land and is again central in God's plan (cf. Romans 11:25-27).
                </p>
                <p>
                    John measures "the temple of God, and the altar, and those who worship there", suggesting that God
                    acknowledges a faithful remnant of Jewish worshipers in the Tribulation temple <sup>3</sup>. However, John is
                    told not to measure the outer court, "for it has been given to the Gentiles." In other words, while God
                    recognizes the inner worship (true believers faithful to Him), the outer court (the external religious system
                    or the city at large) is dominated by Gentile nations. Jesus foretold that "Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles
                    until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled" (Luke 21:24). Revelation 11:2 picks up that theme: "the holy city
                    [Jerusalem] shall they [Gentiles tread under foot forty and two months." According to many premillennial
                    expositors, this 42-month period corresponds to the final three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation (often
                    called "the Great Tribulation") <sup>5</sup>. It is "the last three and a half years of the final seven that compose
                    Daniel's seventieth week" - a period of intense trouble for Jerusalem until Gentile domination is broken at
                    Christ's Second Coming <sup>6</sup>. During that 31¬Ω years ("forty-two months"), Jerusalem will be largely under the
                    sway of Gentile powers and the forces of the Antichrist, even as God works to purify and redeem Israel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notably, John's measuring of the temple parallels other biblical visions of measuring God's special places:
                    e.g. Ezekiel measuring the millennial temple (Ezk. 40:3-5) and an angel measuring the New Jerusalem (Rev.
                    21:15-16). Similarly, Zechariah saw a man measuring the city of Jerusalem as a sign that God would restore
                    it: "Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls... For I... will be a wall of fire all around her, and I will be
                    the glory in her midst" (Zech. 2:4-5) <sup>7</sup>. The command to measure in Revelation 11 thus signals God's intent
                    to restore and protect a believing people in Jerusalem, even though the city will be partly overrun by
                    unbelievers for a time <sup>3</sup>.
                </p>

                <h3>Personal Application:</h3>
                <p>
                    Even in times of judgment, God knows "those who
                    worship there" - He knows His true worshipers. Just as the measuring reed marked out those who belonged
                    to God, we are encouraged to be found as true worshipers whom God "marks" as His own. In perilous
                    times, God will preserve His faithful remnant.
                </p>

                <h2>Verses 3-6: The Two Witnesses and Their Prophetic Ministry</h2>
                <p>
                    "And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred and
                    sixty days, clothed in sackcloth." (Rev. 11:3)
                </p>
                <p>
                    After mentioning the 42 months of Gentile trampling, verse 3 introduces God's response in that same era:
                    "My two witnesses" who prophesy for 1260 days. 1260 days is 3¬Ω years, the same length as 42 months
                    (using biblical 30-day months). Many interpreters see these two time spans as referring to the same 312-
                    year period, described first from the perspective of Gentile oppression (42 months) and then from the
                    perspective of God's concurrent witness (1260 days) <sup>8 9</sup>. Others, like Plymouth Brethren author H.A.
                    Ironside, have suggested that the 1260 days may cover the first half of the seven-year end times period,
                    during which the witnesses preach, and the 42 months the last half during which Jerusalem is fully
                    trampled by Antichrist's forces <sup>10 11</sup>. In either case, 3¬Ω years is a dominant prophetic timeframe
                    (appearing also in Daniel 7:25, Dan. 12:7, Rev. 12:6, Rev. 13:5), indicating that God has set a fixed, limited
                    period for both the Tribulation's horrors and His special witnesses' ministry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These "two witnesses" are vested with power and clothed in sackcloth, the traditional garb of repentance
                    and mourning. They are God's prophetic agents, preaching repentance and warning of judgment during the
                    Tribulation. The text calls them "the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the God of the
                    earth" (Rev. 11:4). This is a direct reference to Zechariah's vision of a golden lampstand fed by two olive
                    trees, which symbolized anointed servants of God (specifically Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the
                    governor in Zech. 4:2-14). Just as those two men were "sons of oil" empowering Israel's post-exilic
                    restoration, the Revelation 11 witnesses are Spirit-empowered lights in a dark time. They have a priestly
                    aspect (worshiping at the altar) and a prophetic aspect (proclaiming God's word), providing a complete
                    testimony to God's truth <sup>12</sup>. The number two itself is significant: under God's Law, "by the mouth of two or
                    three witnesses every word shall be established" (2 Cor. 13:1, cf. Deut. 19:15). Thus "two" represents an
                    adequate, divinely required testimony to the truth <sup>13</sup>. Some teachers believe this could mean more than
                    two individuals are collectively represented, since two is the minimum for valid testimony <sup>14 13</sup> Plymouth
                    Brethren expositors caution that Revelation's style is symbolic, so "to make it two [people] literally" might miss
                    the larger representative principle <sup>14</sup>. In other words, the "two witnesses" may not be only two lone
                    men, but could signify a faithful remnant of Israel (aligned in priestly and prophetic witness) whom God
                    empowers to testify. However, other scholars take the text more literally and expect two specific prophets
                    will arise. Traditionally, suggestions for their identity are Moses and Elijah based on the nature of their
                    miracles - or Enoch and Elijah - based on the fact that Enoch and Elijah never died (see Gen. 5:24, 2 Kings
                    2:11) and could return to face death as these witnesses do. The text itself does not name them, but it
                    strongly evokes the ministries of Elijah and Moses. Verse 6 says the witnesses "have power to shut heaven,
                    so that no rain falls in the days of their prophecy; and they have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to
                    strike the earth with all plagues, as often as they desire." This mirrors Elijah's miracle of sealing the heavens
                    from rain (1 Kings 17:1 which lasted 3¬Ω years, Jas. 5:17) and Moses' miracles of turning water to blood
                    and calling down plagues on Egypt (Exodus 7-12). Indeed, their ministry is explicitly "in the power and spirit
                    of Elijah and Moses," whether one views them as those very men returned or as others who minister in a
                    similar prophetic anointing <sup>15 16</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Importantly, these witnesses minister in a period when formal "royalty" in Israel is still absent (Christ's
                    Kingdom not yet established) but they provide sufficient testimony to God's truth during Israel's
                    apostasy <sup>17</sup>. They prophesy "clothed in sackcloth", indicating their message is one of repentance and
                    sorrow over sin. Just as John the Baptist (a type of Elijah) preached repentance to prepare for Christ's first
                    coming, these prophets call Israel to repentance in anticipation of Christ's second coming and "the
                    restitution of all things" promised by God (Acts 3:19-21) <sup>10 18</sup>. We are told God Himself empowers them: "I
                    will give power to my two witnesses... and if anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and
                    devours their enemies" (11:3,5). They are supernaturally protected and enabled. Like many prophets of old,
                    they can invoke divine judgments to authenticate their message - much as Elijah called down fire (2 Kings
                    1:10-12) and Moses's words brought plagues. In fact, "if anyone desires to hurt them, he must be killed in this
                    manner" (11:5), showing that no enemy can stop these witnesses until their mission is complete <sup>19 20</sup>.
                    This echoes the principle seen in Jesus' ministry ("His hour had not yet come," John 7:30) - God's servants
                    are "immortal until their work is done." As William Kelly observes, "They are preserved in spite of the Beast,
                    until their work is done; but directly their testimony is concluded, the Beast is allowed to overcome them. It is just
                    as it was with the Lord... There was all possible willingness to destroy them long before, but somehow it could not
                    be done" <sup>21</sup>.

                    The mission of the Two Witnesses reminds us that God always has His faithful
                    messengers even in the darkest times. They serve as a model of courageous witness. Like them, we are
                    called to be "olive trees" and "lampstands" - empowered by the Holy Spirit to shine forth God's light in a
                    corrupt world. Their example encourages us to speak truth boldly and call people to repentance, depending
                    on God's power rather than our own. Moreover, their story teaches that God will protect us until we finish
                    the work He has for us (cf. Psalm 91:1-7). We need not fear the opposition of the world, for nothing can
                    snatch us out of God's hand while our assignment continues. Our duty is to be faithful witnesses; the
                    results, and the duration of our service, are in God's sovereign hands.

                <h2>Verses 7-10: The Death of the Witnesses and the World's Reaction</h2>
                <p>
                    "When they finish their testimony, the beast that ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war
                    against them, overcome them, and kill them. (8) And their dead bodies will lie in the street of the
                    great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. (9) Then
                    those from the peoples, tribes, tongues, and nations will see their dead bodies three-and-a-half
                    days, and not allow their dead bodies to be put into graves. (10) And those who dwell on the earth
                    will rejoice over them, make merry, and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets
                    tormented those who dwell on the earth." (Rev. 11:7-10)
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 1260 days of powerful preaching, "when they finish their testimony," God's protective restraint is
                    lifted and "the Beast" emerges as the instrument of their martyrdom. This is the first time Revelation
                    explicitly mentions "the beast", who is later described in detail in Revelation 13. He is said to "ascend out of
                    the bottomless pit" (the Abyss), indicating he is empowered by demonic, hellish forces. This Beast is
                    understood in premillennial theology to be the future Antichrist or final world tyrant, often identified
                    with the "man of sin" or "lawless one" in 2 Thessalonians 2:3-8. More specifically, Plymouth Brethren
                    expositors see him as the head of the revived Roman Empire (a federation of 10 nations), the very one
                    who demands worship of himself and persecutes the saints <sup>22</sup>. Ironside describes this Beast as "the vile
                    head of the coming revived Roman Empire, or western federation of nations, who will not tolerate any worship but
                    that which is offered to himself" <sup>22</sup>. It is he who finally "makes war against [the witnesses], overcomes them and
                    kills them." This fulfills the hint given earlier in Revelation 11: the world will seemingly triumph over God's
                    witnesses - but only when God permits and their work is done.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The great city in which they are killed is identified pointedly as Jerusalem - "where also our Lord was crucified"
                    (v.8). But spiritually, John says, this city is called "Sodom" and "Egypt." In other words, Jerusalem in that
                    future time will be so morally corrupt ("Sodom") and spiritually in bondage ("Egypt") that those names are
                    fitting metaphors <sup>23</sup>. What a tragic description of the holy city! Once the center of God's covenant people,
                    Jerusalem at the end of the age will largely align with the Antichrist, even to the point of celebrating the
                    death of God's prophets. Just as the Old Testament prophets likened Jerusalem to Sodom for its sins (Isaiah
                    1:9-10, Ezekiel 16:46, cf. Luke 17:28-30), here she has reached the lowest point of apostasy. Yet we should
                    remember, a faithful remnant in Jerusalem is still worshiping God (as implied by those measured in
                    the temple) but the city as a whole has turned to wickedness. Because of this apostasy, Jerusalem will
                    undergo severe judgment and purification in the Tribulation (Zechariah 13:8-9).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Verse 9 shows that the Witnesses' humiliation is made public and international: people from all tribes and
                    nations gaze on their corpses for three and a half days. In the ancient world it might have been hard to
                    imagine how "all peoples" would see an event in one city, but today one can easily envision global news
                    coverage broadcasting their dead bodies. The wicked gloat by not allowing them a decent burial - a sign of
                    utmost contempt (cf. Psalm 79:2-3). Instead, the world treats this as a macabre celebration. "Those who
                    dwell on the earth" - a phrase Revelation uses for the unbelieving world - "rejoice over them and make
                    merry, and send gifts to one another" (11:10). It's like an anti-Christmas: the world exchanges gifts in glee
                    because the prophets of God who had tormented their conscience with truth are silenced <sup>24</sup>. This
                    chilling scene has been called by some commentators "the Devil's Christmas", as earth's inhabitants throw a
                    blasphemous party over the death of God's servants <sup>25</sup>. They celebrate because, as the text says, "these two
                    prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth." Indeed, the convicting message and drought and plagues
                    the witnesses brought were unbearable to those hardened in sin. Now, with the witnesses gone, the world
                    mistakenly feels triumph and relief. Ironside vividly describes "the whole apostate world - Christendom and
                    Judaism alike - congratulating one another that there is no longer any voice raised to call in question their wicked
                    ways" <sup>24</sup>. It is a striking illustration of what Jesus said in John 3:19-20 that the world loves darkness and
                    hates the light, and will rejoice when a light is extinguished.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a human perspective, this looks like total defeat for God's cause. The final gospel preachers on earth
                    are dead, evil appears victorious, and unbelievers are throwing a festival. But this "triumph" of evil is
                    extremely short-lived - only 3¬Ω days.

                <p>
                    The death of the two witnesses and the world's
                    reaction remind us that the people of God may face intense hatred and ridicule. There are times when it
                    seems evil has won and truth has fallen in the streets. Yet we are reminded not to judge by immediate
                    appearances. The world that rejoices in iniquity and persecutes the righteous is heaping judgment upon
                    itself (Matthew 5:10-12). As believers, we shouldn't be surprised by opposition - Jesus told His disciples, "the
                    world will rejoice" when you weep and lament, but "your sorrow will be turned to joy" (John 16:20). When we
                    encounter hostility for Christ's sake, we can take heart knowing that God's vindication will come in His time.
                    The world's "party" at the church's expense will not last forever. Our calling is to remain faithful even unto
                    death (Rev. 2:10), trusting that God will ultimately turn our apparent defeats into victories.

                <h2>Verses 11-14: The Resurrection of the Witnesses and Aftermath</h2>
                <p>
                    "Now after the three-and-a-half days the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on
                    their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them. (12) And they heard a loud voice from heaven
                    saying to them, 'Come up here.' And they ascended to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies saw
                    them. (13) In the same hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. In the
                    earthquake seven thousand people were killed, and the rest were afraid and gave glory to the God
                    of heaven. (14) The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly." (Rev. 11:11-14)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just when the world's celebration is in full swing, God intervenes directly. After 3¬Ω days of lying dead, the
                    two witnesses are suddenly resurrected: "the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their
                    feet." One can imagine the camera crews and crowds around these dead prophets - when without warning,
                    they revive! This evokes the Old Testament language of resurrection, such as Ezekiel's vision of dry bones
                    coming to life by God's breath (Ezk. 37:10). It is a public vindication of God's servants. The gloating of the
                    wicked turns to sheer terror: "great fear fell on those who saw them." Indeed, the jubilant party is abruptly cut
                    short as the world witnesses God's power to give life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then a voice from heaven summons the witnesses: "Come up here." In the sight of their enemies, the two
                    prophets ascend to heaven in a cloud. This parallels our Lord Jesus' ascension in a cloud (Acts 1:9) - with
                    the key difference that Jesus' ascension was seen only by His followers, whereas these witnesses ascend
                    in full view of their enemies <sup>26 27</sup>. Thus God provides an undeniable sign to onlookers: He is the author of
                    life and these messengers were truly His. Some interpreters even liken this event to a sort of mini-rapture
                    or foretaste of the "first resurrection", as these faithful martyrs are caught up to heaven in triumph <sup>26</sup>. It
                    demonstrates that "precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints" (Psalm 116:15) He will raise
                    them in honor.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Immediately following their rapture, "in that same hour," a great earthquake strikes the city (Jerusalem). A
                    tenth of the city collapses and 7,000 people are killed. The number seven thousand is striking - it reverses
                    Elijah's day, when 7,000 in Israel had not bowed to Baal (1 Kings 19:18); here, perhaps 7,000 notable persons
                    are slain for their rebellion <sup>28</sup>. The earthquake is a direct act of divine judgment, punctuating the
                    witnesses' ascension. The survivors in Jerusalem respond with shock and a form of reverence: "the rest were
                    afraid and gave glory to the God of heaven." This is a notable statement it is the first time during the
                    Tribulation that we read of people giving glory to God <sup>29</sup>. Throughout Revelation, wicked men usually
                    blaspheme God in response to plagues (e.g. Rev. 16:9-11). Here at least, some acknowledge God's hand. The
                    phrase "God of heaven" (used also in Rev. 16:11) implies they recognize the true God far above their idols.
                    Some expositors hold that this "giving glory" is merely a terrified acknowledgment of God's power, not a
                    genuine repentance unto salvation <sup>29</sup>. The text doesn't explicitly say these people repented or turned to
                    Christ only that they were awestruck and gave glory to God in that moment. It's possible this could lead
                    some to repentance, but at minimum it shows the remaining Jews in Jerusalem realize God has acted
                    (perhaps preparing some hearts to believe later). God is referred to as "the God of heaven" here, whereas in
                    verse 4 He was called "the Lord of the earth." The distinction may suggest that the onlookers fearfully honor
                    God's power at a distance ("He is God in heaven"), yet have not yet submitted to His reign on earth <sup>30</sup>. In
                    any case, the resurrection of the witnesses and the accompanying judgment serve as a final warning to
                    Israel and the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Verse 14 concludes the section: "the second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly." The "second
                    woe" refers to the sixth trumpet judgment (Rev. 9:13-21) together with this interlude of chapter 10 and 11.
                    With the events of the witnesses now finished, that woe is done. The "third woe" will be the seventh and
                    final trumpet that is about to sound <sup>31</sup>. We are being signaled that the climactic moment is imminent.

                    The dramatic resurrection and ascension of the witnesses after 3¬Ω days teaches us
                    God has the final word. Just when evil seems to triumph, God can suddenly turn defeat into victory. For
                    believers, this is a great encouragement - our hope is in the resurrection power of God. We may be "struck
                    down, but not destroyed" (2 Cor. 4:9). The world may rejoice at the church's setbacks, but God will raise His
                    people up in due time. The fear that fell on the onlookers is a preview of that awe all mankind will face when
                    God openly intervenes. It challenges us personally: will we give glory to the God of heaven now, in
                    repentance and faith, or only tremble later under compulsion? How much better to glorify God willingly
                    today by believing His word, than to only acknowledge Him in fearful crisis! For the faithful, the witnesses'
                    story is a reminder that our labor in the Lord is not in vain even if the world scorns us, God is able to
                    vindicate and reward His servants, even beyond the grave.
                </p>

                <h2>Verses 15-18: The Seventh Trumpet - Christ's Kingdom Proclaimed</h2>
                <p>
                    "Then the seventh angel sounded: And there were loud voices in heaven, saying, 'The kingdoms of
                    this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and
                    ever!' (16) *And the twenty-four elders who sat before God on their thrones fell on their
                    faces and worshiped God, (17) saying: 'We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, the
                    One who is and who was and who is to come, because You have taken Your great power
                    and reigned. (18) The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the
                    dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets
                    and the saints, and those who fear Your name, small and great, and should destroy those
                    who destroy the earth*." (Rev. 11:15-18, NKJV)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the long-anticipated Seventh Trumpet is blown. Recall that the seven trumpets were introduced
                    back in Revelation 8; the first six trumpets brought various plagues and woes upon the earth. The seventh
                    trumpet is the climactic one - it is associated with the third "woe" (Rev. 11:14) but also with the triumph of
                    God's kingdom. When it sounds, John hears loud voices in heaven heralding the outcome of God's plan: "The
                    kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and
                    ever!" <sup>32</sup>. This is a proleptic proclamation - it announces the assured triumph of God even before all the
                    details have been carried out. In essence, heaven is rejoicing that the time has come for God to decisively
                    take back authority over the world from the usurping powers of evil. What a statement of victory! All the
                    worldly kingdoms are hereby declared under the rule of God and His Anointed One (Christ/Messiah). This
                    fufills the promise of Psalm 2: "Why do the nations rage...? I have set My King on My holy hill of Zion... Ask of Me
                    and I will give You the nations for Your inheritance" <sup>33</sup>. It also echoes Daniel 7:14 where the Son of Man
                    receives "dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Heaven's declaration in verse 15 uses the singular: "the kingdom of the world" (Greek: <em>basileia tou kosmou</em>)
                    <sup>34</sup>, implying that all earthly power will be consolidated and handed over to one rightful ruler - the Lord
                    God and His Christ. God the Father ("our Lord" as Jehovah, the covenant God) and His Messiah ("His
                    Christ") share in this reign, for Christ "must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet" (1 Cor. 15:25). The
                    reign will ultimately be forever and ever, spanning the 1000-year millennial kingdom and then the eternal
                    state. At this trumpet sound, the heavenly host knows the end of the age has essentially arrived <sup>35</sup> the
                    mystery of God's waiting is finished and He is claiming His kingship openly (cf. Rev. 10:7). Thus begins the
                    transition from the present evil age to the future kingdom of Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon hearing this, the twenty-four elders - whom we first met in Revelation 4 (symbolizing the redeemed
                    worshipers in heaven, likely representing the completed Church and/or Old & New Testament saints) - fall
                    on their faces and worship God (11:16). They burst into a hymn of thanksgiving (11:17-18). Notably, they
                    address God as "Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was" - but they omit "who is to come" (found
                    back in Rev. 1:8 and 4:8). Why? Because in their praise God "has come" in this vision - the future is now
                    present <sup>36</sup>. They celebrate that the Almighty has taken His great power and begun to reign. What a
                    pivotal moment! For so long, God has allowed human history to run its course under the dominion of
                    Gentile empires (the "times of the Gentiles," Luke 21:24) and under the "god of this world" (2 Cor. 4:4,
                    referring to Satan). But now at last, God asserts His royal prerogative openly. The elders give thanks that the
                    eternal God has assumed His rightful kingship over the world (compare Revelation 19:6, "The Lord God
                    omnipotent reigns!").
                </p>
                <p>
                    In verse 18, the elders' song acknowledges two simultaneous truths: the rebellion of the nations, and the
                    righteous judgment of God. "The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come." This parallels Psalm 2 again:
                    "The nations rage... and the kings plot against the Lord and His Anointed," yet God responds in wrath and sore
                    displeasure (Ps. 2:1,5) <sup>33</sup>. Humanity's anger and Satan's last woe now meet the infinitely greater wrath of
                    God. The time has arrived "for the dead to be judged, and for the reward of Your servants..." <sup>37 38</sup>. This
                    summary statement spans the whole scope of end-time judgment and reward:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        "The time of the dead, that they should be judged" - ultimately, this points to the final judgment
                        of the wicked dead (fulfilled after the millennium at the Great White Throne, Rev. 20:11-15). All who
                        defied God will face Him as Judge. No one will escape account for their deeds. God's full reckoning
                        has come <sup>39 40</sup>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "And that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and those who fear
                        Your name, small and great" - this speaks of the reward for all of God's people. "Prophets" and
                        "saints" and God-fearers include every believer - from renowned prophets and apostles to the
                        simplest faithful soul - "small and great." Jesus promised He would come "and My reward is with Me,
                        to give to every one according to his work" (Rev. 22:12). Now that moment is at hand. This likely alludes
                        to the Judgment Seat of Christ for believers (Rom. 14:10, 2 Cor. 5:10) and the inauguration of the
                        kingdom where saints will receive varying roles or "rewards" (Matt. 25:21, 23) <sup>41 42</sup>. (In a
                        premillennial timeline, the rewarding of Church-age saints occurs earlier at the rapture, but here the
                        focus may be on rewarding the Tribulation saints and Old Testament faithful at Christ's return - see
                        Daniel 12:1-3).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "And should destroy those who destroy the earth." - God will destroy the destroyers. The
                        "destroyers of the earth" refers to the corrupt, unrepentant rebels who have ruined God's creation
                        morally (and perhaps ecologically as well) through sin, violence, and idolatry. All the tyrants,
                        Antichrist and his followers, the persecutors of the innocent - their day of reckoning has come. God
                        will remove from the earth those who would continue to defile it <sup>40</sup>. This is a fitting closure: the
                        time of patient grace is over; now justice will be served to those who ravaged the world.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thus, the seventh trumpet encapsulates the ultimate victory of God's kingdom. As William Kelly noted,
                    "The seventh trumpet brings us down to the close in a general way... It is not merely power in general conferred in
                    heaven, but 'the world-kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ has come'... Here, it will be observed, the end of the
                    age is supposed to be now arrived" <sup>32 35</sup>. In fact, the seventh trumpet is so climactic that it "completes the
                    mystery of God" (Rev. 10:7) - it's heaven's summary that God's plan of the ages is now being fulfilled. The
                    details of how Christ takes possession (the bowl judgments, Armageddon, etc.) will follow in later chapters,
                    but the outcome is already announced here.
                </p>

                <h3>Personal Application:</h3>
                <p>
                    The sounding of the seventh trumpet and the proclamation of Christ's kingdom is a
                    reminder that all of history is moving toward the reign of God. In our personal lives, this should inspire
                    hope and perseverance. No matter how chaotic or evil the world seems now, we know the final chapter: "He
                    shall reign forever and ever." When we pray "Thy kingdom come" (Matt. 6:10), we are aligning with this very
                    moment when God's will is done on earth as it is in heaven. The seventh trumpet assures us that God will
                    reward the faithfulness of His people even the smallest act done for His name will not be forgotten
                    (Mark 9:41). It also warns us that persistent rebellion will be judged God will "destroy" the unrepentant
                    destroyers of His world. For us, the call is to fear His name (revere and trust Him) now, so that we will be
                    among "His servants" who are rewarded, not among His enemies who perish. This vision of the coming
                    Kingdom motivates us to live a godly life in anticipation. As 2 Peter 3:13-14 says, "We, according to His
                    promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells. Therefore... be diligent to be found
                    by Him in peace, spotless and blameless." Knowing the King will soon take up His power encourages us to be
                    faithful and not lose heart in present struggles. Our God reigns
                    Hallelujah!
                    and will reign openly
                    forever.

                <h2>Verse 19: The Temple of God Opened in Heaven (The Ark of His
                    Covenant)</h2>
                <p>
                    "Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of His covenant was seen in His
                    temple. And there were lightnings, noises, thunderings, an earthquake, and great hail." (Rev.
                    11:19)
                </p>
                <p>
                    This final verse of chapter 11 serves as a transition into the next series of visions (chapters 12-14). John's
                    attention shifts back to heaven, where the true Temple of God is opened. Recall that the Tabernacle/
                    Temple on earth was patterned after the heavenly reality (Hebrews 8:5). Now John sees the Ark of the
                    Covenant visible in God's heavenly temple. The Ark of the Covenant was the golden chest in the Holy of
                    Holies, representing God's throne and His covenant presence among Israel (Exodus 25:21-22). Its
                    appearance here is highly symbolic. In the Old Testament, the Ark went before Israel in battle and signified
                    God remembering His covenant promises. Seeing the Ark in heaven at this juncture suggests that God is
                    about to act in faithfulness to His covenant with His people Israel <sup>43</sup>. In fact, chapters 12-14 will
                    introduce the key players of the end times, including Israel (symbolically portrayed as a woman) and the
                    Satanic beasts. So the Ark here may indicate that God has not forgotten His ancient covenant - He is moving
                    to fulfill all promises to Abraham's descendants, even as the final judgments unfold.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the scene is accompanied by dramatic phenomena: "lightnings, noises, thunderings, an earthquake,
                    and great hail." These mirror the manifestations of God's judgment and majesty seen elsewhere (cf. Rev. 8:5,
                    16:18-21). It tells us that the revelation of the Ark is not for mercy now, but for judgment - the "day of
                    vengeance" has come. One commentator notes: "The temple of God is opened in heaven, the ark of His
                    covenant is seen which refers to Israel - but judgment characterizes it now; judgments of all kinds (lightnings,
                    earthquake, hail) ensue" <sup>43</sup>. In other words, God is revealing the Ark (a sign of His covenant faithfulness to
                    redeem Israel), yet simultaneously unleashing the climactic judgments against a rebellious world. Both
                    mercy and wrath proceed from His throne. The "great hail" is especially a hallmark of divine judgment (cf.
                    Exodus 9:23-26, Joshua 10:11); Revelation 16:21 will describe the plague of huge hailstones during the final
                    bowl judgment. Thus, Rev. 11:19 is like a thunderclap announcing: pay attention - God's sanctuary is open and
                    the final drama is about to commence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a literary perspective, many expositors (including Brethren teachers like Ironside and Kelly) view 11:19
                    as belonging thematically with chapter 12 <sup>36 44</sup>. Chapter 12 will immediately present the vision of the
                    woman, child, and dragon - symbolic of Israel, Messiah, and Satan - which indeed is linked to the Ark of the
                    covenant (God's promise to Israel) and the heavenly temple. In any case, as chapter 11 closes, heaven
                    reveals that God's presence and covenant are central to what happens next. Earth is about to witness
                    both the rage of Satan and the wrath of God, but over it all is the sovereignty of the Ark's Lord.
                </p>

                <h3>Personal Application:</h3>
                <p>
                    The glimpse of the Ark of the Covenant in heaven reassures us that God never
                    forgets His promises. The Ark was the symbol of God's faithfulness - it contained the stone tablets of the
                    Law, signifying God's word and covenant. Likewise, we can trust that every promise of God is secure and will
                    be fulfilled in His timing. For Israel, this vision is a guarantee of their ultimate restoration when Christ
                    returns to establish His kingdom. For us, it's a reminder of God's faithfulness to all His people: "He
                    remembers His covenant forever" (Psalm 111:5). Even when thunder, earthquakes, and hail (symbolic of trials
                    or divine discipline) shake our lives, we can look to the "ark of the covenant" - the unshakeable promises
                    of God in Christ. Hebrews 6:19 says God's promise is "an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast." Indeed,
                    in Revelation 11 we see an abundance of turmoil and judgment, yet concluding with the Ark implies that
                    God's covenant love stands firm amid the storm. We should therefore take refuge in His faithfulness and
                    live as people of the covenant, knowing that "He who promised is faithful" (Heb. 10:23).
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
                <p>
                    Revelation chapter 11 is a theologically rich and dramatic portion of Scripture. It bridges the
                    trumpet judgments and the coming conflict between the dragon and the Lamb's forces. In this chapter, we
                    see God's sovereignty on display: He marks out His temple and worshipers; He empowers His witnesses for
                    a time, allowing them to be slain but then raising them in triumph; He brings the rebellious nations to the
                    brink of doom, only to declare the ultimate victory of His Christ. For the student of prophecy, Revelation 11
                    affirms key doctrines of eschatology held by many evangelicals and Plymouth Brethren teachers - such as
                    God's ongoing plan for Israel (the temple, the 70th week), the reality of a future Antichrist (the Beast), the
                    literal 3¬Ω year periods of tribulation, and the premillennial coming of Christ's Kingdom <sup>5 45</sup>. For personal
                    faith, this chapter offers both warning and encouragement. It warns that God's judgment is sure
                    the
                    world that rejoices in sin will face the wrath of a holy God. It also encourages that God cares for His own
                    He will remember His people, empower their witness, limit their persecution, and reward their faithfulness
                    in the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As we reflect on Revelation 11, we should be moved to worship like the elders, saying, "We give You thanks,
                    O Lord God Almighty... because You have taken Your great power and reigned" <sup>37</sup>. The vision of God's ultimate
                    triumph should strengthen our hearts in present difficulties. We can draw several personal lessons: remain
                    zealous in witness (like the two prophets), remain separate from the apostasy of the world (unlike
                    Jerusalem's masses who align with the Beast), remain confident in God's protection and timing, and
                    remain hopeful as we anticipate Christ's reign. Revelation 11 assures us that no matter how deep the night,
                    the morning of God's Kingdom is coming. The kingdoms of this world will indeed become the kingdom of
                    our Lord - and He shall reign forever and ever! Amen. <sup>33 40</sup>
