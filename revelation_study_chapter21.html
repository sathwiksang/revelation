                <h3>Introduction and Context</h3>
                <p>
                    Revelation 21 is one of the most hope-filled and theologically rich chapters in Scripture. It follows the final
                    judgment (Revelation 20) and unveils "a new heaven and a new earth" - the eternal state where God makes all
                    things new. This chapter is crucial for Christian theology, as it describes the ultimate destiny of God's people
                    in the New Jerusalem and God's everlasting fellowship with redeemed humanity. Many Bible teachers have
                    marveled at the depth of this passage. Notably, Plymouth Brethren expositors (a group of 19th-20th
                    century evangelical Christians known for a dispensational, literal approach to prophecy) have provided
                    detailed insights. They often highlight that Revelation 21 has two distinct sections:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Revelation 21:1-8 a description of the eternal state (after Christ's Millennial Kingdom and after
                        the final judgment). William Kelly observes that these verses are "the fullest account that the word of
                        God furnishes of the new heavens and new earth in the proper sense... subsequent to the thousand years'
                        reign [and] the great white throne" <sup>1</sup>. In this eternal state, history has ended and "all time-distinctions
                        are at an end" <sup>2</sup>. God's direct relationship is with "men" (humanity as a whole) with no nations or
                        earthly rulers as distinct entities <sup>3</sup>. All effects of sin and sorrow are removed forever.</li>
                    <li>Revelation 21:9-27 (continuing to 22:5) - a symbolic "appendix" that revisits the vision of the New
                        Jerusalem, portraying it in relation to the Millennial Kingdom (Christ's 1000-year reign). Brethren
                        scholars note that starting at 21:9, John's vision "goes back again to the millennium" <sup>4</sup> <sup>3</sup>. The same
                        New Jerusalem (the "bride, the Lamb's wife") is now shown in its millennial glory, shining over the
                        earth where there are still nations and kings <sup>5</sup>. This interpretation is based on details like the
                        presence of "nations", "kings of the earth", and the need for "healing" (in 22:2), which imply a world
                        where some are still being governed and blessed (conditions characteristic of the Millennium rather
                        than the final eternal state <sup>3</sup> <sup>6</sup>). In eternity, by contrast, all evil is gone and God is "all in all."</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Note: Not all Bible teachers divide the chapter this way. Many evangelical commentators (e.g.
                    Dr. John Walvoord) understand all of 21:1-22:5 as a description of the eternal state, viewing
                    the mentions of nations and kings figuratively <sup>7</sup>. However, for this study we will primarily
                    follow the Plymouth Brethren perspective, which sees a clear chronological distinction at
                    verse 9. This approach yields a rich understanding of both our eternal hope and the glorious
                    role of the Church in the Millennium <sup>8</sup> <sup>9</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With that context, let us proceed verse by verse through Revelation 21, drawing on parallel Scriptures and
                    theological insights. We will explore both doctrinal significance and personal application for each verse.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:1 - "I saw a new heaven and a new earth..."</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">Text: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and
                    there was no more sea." (21:1, KJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    John's vision opens with a dramatic transition: the present creation has vanished, and God unveils a new
                    heaven and a new earth. This fulfills God's ancient promises and displays His power to completely renew
                    creation. The "first" heaven and earth (our current universe) are "passed away," as also described in
                    Revelation 20:11 (earth and sky fled from God's presence) and 2 Peter 3:10-13. The Apostle Peter wrote,
                    "according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness" <sup>10</sup>. In this
                    new creation, righteousness "dwells" permanently - evil has no presence at all <sup>10</sup>. This goes beyond the
                    Millennium (where righteousness reigns but sin and death still exist on earth in some measure); here,
                    righteousness inhabits everything, forever <sup>11</sup> <sup>12</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    John's language deliberately echoes Old Testament prophecy. Isaiah 65:17 first recorded God saying,
                    "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall not be remembered". However, as
                    expositors like William Kelly and Edward Dennett note, Isaiah's context shows that he was describing a
                    renewed order largely within time (often understood as the blissful conditions of Christ's future kingdom
                    on earth) <sup>13</sup> <sup>14</sup>. For example, Isaiah 65 goes on to mention people still dying at a hundred years old (a
                    great age, but death nonetheless - Isaiah 65:20) <sup>12</sup> <sup>15</sup>. In contrast, Revelation 21:1 uses "new heaven and
                    new earth" in the absolute, fullest sense - an eternal order where death itself is abolished <sup>14</sup> <sup>16</sup>. The Old
                    Testament gave a preview (a "qualified" use of the phrase), whereas the New Testament gives the ultimate
                    reality <sup>14</sup> <sup>17</sup>. This shows the progression of revelation: what Isaiah foresaw in part, John sees in its
                    complete fulfillment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    John adds, "and there was no more sea." This detail may seem small, but it carries profound meaning. In our
                    current world, seas are literally vast bodies of water that separate lands and peoples. Symbolically in
                    Scripture (especially in Revelation), the sea often represents chaos, unrest, and the rebellious masses of
                    humanity (contrast "the wicked are like the troubled sea" in Isaiah 57:20). No more sea therefore signifies at
                    least two truths:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No Separation: The sea is a "barrier" that keeps people apart. In the new earth, humanity will no
                        longer be divided geographically or relationally - there will be perfect unity and togetherness <sup>18</sup>.
                        All believers will enjoy unbroken fellowship with God and each other, with nothing like an ocean to
                        separate us. Today, we experience many kinds of separation (distance, death, cultural divides), but
                        God is promising an ultimate togetherness of His family. Personal Application: This assures us that
                        all painful separations (even death itself) will be overcome. We can take comfort that in eternity we
                        will be reunited with God's people in perfect union.</li>
                    <li>No Chaos or Rebellion: In prophetic imagery, the "sea" can represent the turbulent, unordered
                        nations of the world (contrast with the "earth" symbolizing ordered society or stable government)
                        <sup>19</sup>. "No more sea" thus means no more disorder or rebellion against God. Every part of the new
                        earth will be under God's perfect governance <sup>19</sup>. There will be absolute peace - no raging waves of
                        sin or unrest. One Brethren writer explains that the new earth will be "the perfect expression of [God's]
                        own will", finally answering the Lord's Prayer: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." <sup>20</sup> <sup>21</sup>. In
                        other words, just as Christ once calmed the stormy sea with "Peace, be still," in the new creation all
                        of creation is stilled under the peace of His lordship. Personal Application: Even now, we are called
                        to submit to God's order and find peace in His will. The promise of a world with no more "sea"
                        encourages us that every storm will ultimately be calmed. Believers can endure present chaos with
                        hope, knowing God will bring everlasting peace.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Whether "no more sea" will also be literal (i.e. the new earth having no oceans at all) is debated, but clearly
                    even if literal, it points to these deeper spiritual realities. In sum, verse 1 gives us a breathtaking first glimpse
                    of eternity: an entirely new creation free from the flaws of the old. For a Christian, this sparks hope - "we,
                    according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth" (2 Peter 3:13) - and it challenges us to hold
                    loosely to this present world, since something far better is coming.

                <h2>Revelation 21:2 - "The holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God..."</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And I John saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared as a bride
                    adorned for her husband." (21:2)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After seeing the broad panorama of a renewed creation, John's focus narrows to a specific feature: the Holy
                    City. He calls it New Jerusalem, a name loaded with meaning. This city is described as "coming down from
                    God out of heaven," indicating its divine origin and nature. It is "prepared as a bride adorned for her
                    husband." The imagery of a bride tells us this city is not merely bricks and mortar it represents a
                    community of people deeply loved by Christ. In fact, later in the chapter an angel explicitly identifies the
                    New Jerusalem with "the bride, the Lamb's wife"* (v.9-10). This signifies that the city symbolizes the
                    redeemed people of God in their glorified, perfected state - especially the Church. As one commentator notes, "in
                    this New Jerusalem we have in symbol the church of God, which is the bride of Christ" <sup>22</sup>. The false city
                    "Babylon" (chapters 17-18) was depicted as an immoral woman; by contrast, the true city is depicted as a
                    pure bride <sup>22</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's unpack some key aspects of verse 2:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Holy city, New Jerusalem": In the Bible, Jerusalem was the beloved city of God's people, the place
                        where God's temple stood. This New Jerusalem is the ultimate fulfillment of all that the old Jerusalem
                        foreshadowed. It is "holy" - completely pure and set apart for God. The prophet Isaiah and apostle
                        Paul both anticipated a heavenly Jerusalem. Isaiah spoke of God creating "Jerusalem a rejoicing" in a
                        context that hints at future glory (Isaiah 65:18). Paul explicitly calls it "Jerusalem which is above"
                        (Galatians 4:26) and "the mother of us [believers]", and Hebrews 11:10 says Abraham looked for "the
                        city... whose builder and maker is God" <sup>23</sup>. These references point to a real yet spiritual city
                        designed and built by God for His people. John now sees that very city. Importantly, it comes "down
                        out of heaven" meaning its origin is divine, not human. Mankind has always tried to build
                        utopias (even the Tower of Babel was an attempt at a city reaching heaven), but the true City of God
                        comes from God. Jesus told His disciples, "I go to prepare a place for you" (John 14:2). This verse
                        suggests that preparation is complete: the New Jerusalem is that place prepared by Christ, now
                        descending into the new creation as a gift from God to His people.</li>
                    <li>"Prepared as a bride adorned for her husband": The beauty and glory of this city are likened to a
                        bride on her wedding day. Think of a bride making herself as lovely as possible for the one she loves
                        - it's the height of purity, joy, and relationship. In Ephesians 5:25-27, Christ is said to love the Church
                        as His bride, "that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle... holy
                        and without blemish." That moment of presentation is here! The New Jerusalem "bride" has been
                        made perfectly ready for eternal communion with Christ <sup>24</sup>. A Plymouth Brethren writer points out
                        that although ages (the Millennial thousand years) will have passed, the city "is still seen arrayed in all
                        her bridal beauty, as much without blemish or wrinkle... as on the day" she was first presented to Christ
                        <sup>24</sup>. In other words, the purity and joy of the Church's union with Christ never fade with time - she
                        remains eternally lovely to Him. This speaks of the permanence of our relationship with Jesus.
                        Personal Application: Believers are part of this bride. It's a reminder that our destiny is intimate
                        fellowship with Christ. Just as a bride prepares for her wedding, we should prepare ourselves now -
                        pursuing holiness and love for Christ - for that coming marriage supper (Revelation 19:7-8). We take
                        heart that Christ Himself is working even now to sanctify us, so we will one day be perfectly
                        "adorned" by His grace.</li>
                    <li>The Church and Israel: Some wonder if New Jerusalem includes Old Testament saints (Israel) or only
                        the Church. The imagery of "bride" most directly applies to the Church (the new-covenant people
                        saved between Christ's first and second comings). Yet the city's name "Jerusalem" and later details
                        (like gates named after Israel's tribes, v.12) show that Old Testament saints also have a place in
                        God's city. A balanced view is that all the redeemed are ultimately residents of this glorious city, but
                        that the Church holds a special role as the "bride" in closest relationship to Christ <sup>25</sup> <sup>26</sup>. One
                        Brethren commentator explains that in the eternal state, "the tabernacle (dwelling) is the holy city [the
                        Church]" in which God lives, while "men" (all the saved of all ages) live on the new earth around and
                        enjoy God's presence as His people <sup>25</sup>. All are blessed, but God's wisdom in redemption is displayed
                        in differing roles yet with no envy or distance, only perfection in every part <sup>26</sup>. Thus, New
                        Jerusalem can be seen as the totality of God's redeemed people in glory, with the Church as the
                        jewel at its heart (the bride).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In sum, verse 2 gives us a vision of ultimate community - the people of God in perfect holiness and unity,
                    originating from God's heaven, and beautiful beyond description, like a radiant bride. This is our future
                    home. Jesus' promise that the meek "shall inherit the earth" (Matthew 5:5) comes to fruition here: the earth is
                    made new, and the greatest city ever imagined is given to God's people as an inheritance. What a
                    motivation to persevere in faith! If we are citizens of that city (Philippians 3:20), we ought to live as
                    "strangers and pilgrims" here, setting our hearts on things above.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:3 - "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men..."</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, 'Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will
                    dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them and be their God." (21:3)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    A loud proclamation now interprets the significance of the descending New Jerusalem. It announces the
                    climactic truth of Scripture: God and humanity reunited. In Eden, God walked with Adam and Eve; that
                    fellowship was broken by sin. Throughout history, God's desire has been to dwell among His people
                    (Leviticus 26:11-12, Ezekiel 37:27). Here in verse 3, we finally see the full realization of Emmanuel - "God
                    with us" on a cosmic scale.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Key phrases and their meaning:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The tabernacle of God is with men" - The word tabernacle means dwelling place or tent. In the Old
                        Testament, the tabernacle was the portable sanctuary where God's presence stayed in the midst of
                        Israel's camp (Exodus 25:8). It was a foreshadowing that God wanted to live among His people.
                        Notice it does not say "the temple of God" here, but tabernacle. One commentator notes that in
                        Revelation, the word for temple (naos, inner sanctuary) is used elsewhere, but here "tabernacle" is
                        chosen deliberately <sup>27</sup>. The tabernacle harkens back to the earliest form of God's dwelling with
                        man, suggesting intimacy and God's immediate presence in the community. Now, what is this
                        tabernacle? The voice doesn't say "in" men, but "with men." Given verse 2, the city itself is the
                        tabernacle i.e. God's dwelling is the New Jerusalem, in the midst of humanity <sup>28</sup> <sup>25</sup>. And as
                        established, the city symbolizes the Church. So this beautifully implies: God dwells in and among
                        His people forever. The Church collectively is called a "holy temple" or dwelling of God even now
                        (Ephesians 2:21-22), but then it will be in the fullest, most literal way. All barriers (physical or
                        spiritual) between God and His people will be gone.</li>
                    <li>"With men... they shall be His people"
                        Importantly, it says God's dwelling is with men (plural,
                        humanity), and they (all of them) shall be His people. This indicates the scope of God's plan: not just
                        one nation (like Israel of old) and not only the Church, but all redeemed people together are "His
                        people" and He is "their God." In the eternal state, the distinctions between Jew and Gentile, or
                        among different ages of redemption, fade in the presence of God's glory <sup>29</sup>. There is one huge
                        family of the redeemed, and God lives in the midst of all ("men" in general). As Kelly observed, in
                        eternity "there is no such thing then as kings and nations" in the old sense <sup>29</sup>. We are simply "His
                        people." This fulfills the repeated covenant promise found throughout Scripture: "I will be their God,
                        and they will be My people" (see Jeremiah 31:33, Ezekiel 37:27, 2 Corinthians 6:16). Never before has it
                        been as perfectly true as it will be then. Personal Application: The heart of salvation is not just
                        escaping hell or enjoying heaven's luxuries - it is being with God as His people. Here we see our
                        highest joy: God giving Himself to us in relationship ("God Himself will be with them"). Even now,
                        through Christ, we are brought into fellowship with God (1 Peter 3:18). But we still "see through a
                        glass darkly" - then we will see Him face to face. Take comfort that God wants you in His presence. All
                        of history is moving toward this loving fellowship. We should likewise desire to be "with God,"
                        practicing His presence daily.</li>
                    <li>Emphasis "God Himself": The verse emphasizes "God Himself shall be with them". It is God in His
                        fullness, not through intermediaries or types. In the Old Testament, God's presence was in the
                        tabernacle's Holy of Holies, and people could not draw too near; only the high priest could enter that
                        inner sanctuary once a year. In the New Jerusalem, the entire city is like a Holy of Holies, and
                        every person is welcomed in, because God's presence fills it (compare verse 16 where the city's
                        shape is a perfect cube - just like the Holy of Holies was a cube). There is no temple building in this
                        city (verse 22), meaning no separate chamber needed God Himself is the temple, and we dwell
                        inside His immediate presence. F.B. Hole notes that in the eternal state, "His desire to dwell [with men]
                        will be finally accomplished" - God's great plan from Eden onward reaches completion <sup>30</sup> <sup>31</sup>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In the last part of verse 3, the voice essentially restates the covenant formula: "He will dwell with them... God
                    Himself shall be with them and be their God." This double emphasis shows how important this is to God. It's as
                    if God says: "At last, I am with my children forever, and they are truly Mine." This is the ultimate blessing of
                    heaven: God's presence. All the splendors described (golden streets, jewels, etc.) are secondary to this
                    central truth. As Psalm 16:11 says, "In Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures
                    forevermore." For personal devotion, we can reflect: Do I yearn for God's presence above all, as He desires
                    mine? The loud announcement in verse 3 invites us to "Behold" this reality to gaze on it, believe it, and let
                    it shape our lives. When we know that our destiny is to be God's people living with God forever, it puts our
                    trials in perspective and gives us a powerful hope to purify ourselves (1 John 3:2-3).
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:4 - "God shall wipe away all tears... no more death, sorrow, crying, or pain"</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor
                    crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." (21:4)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one of the most cherished promises in Scripture. Here we see the tenderness of God toward His
                    redeemed. The Almighty who sits on the throne (v.5) personally wipes away every tear from our eyes. It
                    evokes the image of a loving parent comforting a child - but on an eternal, cosmic scale. Let's break down
                    the beautiful guarantees in this verse:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes": This indicates that God personally removes
                        every cause of grief. The phrasing suggests not merely that tears dry up, but that God actively
                        comforts us, eliminating sorrow at its source. Isaiah prophesied similarly, "The Lord God will wipe
                        away tears from off all faces" (Isaiah 25:8), and here it is fulfilled. Consider the intimacy: God doesn't
                        delegate this; He Himself does it. Every hurt, disappointment, and sadness we've carried will be
                        addressed by His own hand. Personal Application: We all carry sorrows and shed tears in this life.
                        This promise assures us that none of those tears are ignored by God one day He will wipe them
                        away forever. Knowing this, we can trust Him with our pain now, and let the hope of His comfort
                        sustain us. As 2 Corinthians 4:17 says, "our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far
                        more exceeding and eternal weight of glory." The eternal comfort will far outweigh the temporal pain.</li>
                    <li>"No more death": Death is called "the last enemy" in 1 Corinthians 15:26, and here we see it
                        abolished. In the new creation, no one will ever die again. All the resurrected saints have glorified,
                        immortal bodies (1 Corinthians 15:53-55). "Former things have passed away" - and death was part of
                        the former things under the curse (Genesis 2:17, 3:19). This fulfills what was promised: "Death is
                        swallowed up in victory" (Isaiah 25:8, 1 Cor 15:54). Imagine a world with no funerals, no goodbyes, no
                        aging into frailty - ever! It's hard to fathom, but this is the Christian's hope. "God shall wipe away all
                        tears... there shall be no more death" <sup>32</sup> <sup>33</sup>.</li>
                    <li>"Neither sorrow, nor crying... neither any more pain": All forms of suffering are included in this
                        sweeping promise. Sorrow (grief, heartache), crying (the outward expression of distress one
                        commentator notes this word implies the "outcry" or clamor of anguish in a fallen world <sup>32</sup>), and
                        pain (whether physical pain or emotional anguish) will be no more. Think of every cause of tears or
                        pain in life: illness, loneliness, betrayal, fears, injuries, disappointments God will ensure none of
                        these ever afflict His children again. "Former things" like sickness and tragedy will be as though they
                        never were. In our current world, "the whole creation groans" (Romans 8:22) and we ourselves groan
                        inwardly. But in that world, only rejoicing. F.B. Hole beautifully comments: "The things that will never
                        enter those blissful scenes are all painfully familiar to us at present. We know them only too well!" <sup>32</sup>.
                        Indeed, all five sources of human sorrow mentioned (tears, death, mourning, crying, pain) are things
                        every person experiences now - but God Himself will remove them.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    It's worth noting that during Christ's future Millennial reign, many of these sorrows will be dramatically
                    reduced - life spans will increase, joy will abound, etc. But only in the eternal state are they completely
                    eradicated <sup>33</sup>. For example, in the Millennium death will still occur for some (though rare), and there will
                    be the need for Christ's rule to restrain sin. In Revelation 21:4's scene, even the possibility of sin or curse or
                    death is gone ("no more... any pain"). The ultimate healing has taken place.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The former things have passed away." This is a summary explanation: the entire old order, with
                        its curse and its grief, is finished. Earlier in Revelation, at the blowing of the seventh trumpet, loud
                        voices said, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord... and He shall reign forever...
                        and He will destroy those who destroy the earth" (Rev 11:15,18). Now we witness that outcome: all
                        destructive, hurtful things are gone. The phrasing here intentionally mirrors Isaiah 65:17 "the former
                        shall not be remembered, nor come into mind." The memory of the painful past will be overshadowed
                        by the glory of the new.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: This verse is one we can turn to in our hardest moments. It's God's promise that every
                    wound will be healed. Knowing this, we do not grieve "as others who have no hope" (1 Thessalonians 4:13).
                    Each tear we shed now is temporary and seen by God (Psalm 56:8 says He keeps our tears in His bottle). A
                    day is appointed when He will tenderly wipe them all away. Let this hope spur us to endurance. And more
                    let it spur us to gratitude and worship. We can start rejoicing now for what God will certainly do.
                    Revelation 21:4 is truly a balm: reading it, we can almost feel God's hand brushing our cheeks, saying, "No
                    more tears, my child."
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:5 - "Behold, I make all things new."</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And He that sat upon the throne said, 'Behold, I make all things new.' And He said unto me, 'Write: for these
                    words are true and faithful.'" (21:5)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now God Himself speaks directly (the speaker is "He who sits on the throne," a title used of God in
                    Revelation 4:2, or possibly Christ as God). His pronouncement sums up what John is witnessing: "Behold
                    (look!), I am making everything new." God wants us to take notice ("Behold!") of this marvelous
                    transformation. Every trace of the old creation cursed by sin is being replaced with a new creation
                    unmarred by sin. This is the great renewal that the prophets and apostles foresaw. Jesus promised at the
                    regeneration (palingenesia) of all things, His followers would reign with Him (Matthew 19:28). Here, that
                    regeneration is stated plainly by God: all things new!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the scope: not just a new earth, but all things. A new universe, new realms of glory, and even we
                    are made new (with glorified bodies and perfected spirits). The same Lord who once said, "Behold, I create
                    new heavens and a new earth" now declares it done. This statement also reminds us of 2 Corinthians 5:17,
                    "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new."
                    That personal new birth we experience now is the firstfruits; here in Revelation is the final harvest of
                    newness - new creation in totality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Plymouth Brethren commentator notes that this renewing is the work of Christ: He created the first
                    creation by His word in Genesis, and here "He speaks and it is done" for the new creation <sup>34</sup>. Indeed, the
                    verse continues with God commanding John to "Write, for these words are true and faithful." God vouches for
                    this promise - it is utterly trustworthy because God's own character stands behind it. "True and faithful"
                    echo Revelation 19:11 where Christ is called Faithful and True. It underlines that what is being revealed is no
                    fantasy; it is a guaranteed reality. John must write it down to assure all readers that God will do this.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, telling John to "write" here (even though John has been writing all along) adds solemnity. It's as if God
                    is saying: "Make sure not to miss this, record it plainly!" For us, it means we should record this on our hearts.
                    When life's troubles make us doubt, we recall: God's words are faithful and true. He will make all things new.
                    There is an almost gentle rebuke in this command - perhaps John was so awestruck he paused writing, so
                    God reminded him. God wants the Church to have this hope in writing, to lean on it in every age.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: Embrace the newness that God promises. Already, if we belong to Christ, He is making
                    us new from the inside out. One day, He will complete that work, and even give us a new environment
                    suited to our new nature. Whenever you feel weary of the brokenness around or within you, hear God say,
                    "I am making everything new." It is both a promise and a process
                    ultimately finished in eternity, but
                    applicable now as He renews our minds (Romans 12:2) and grows us in grace. We serve a God of
                     resurrection and restoration; nothing is beyond His power to renew.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:6 - "It is done...I am Alpha and Omega... I will give of the fountain of the water of life freely."</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And He said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him
                    that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely." (21:6)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    God's declaration continues in verse 6 with several profound statements:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"It is done." This parallels Christ's words on the cross, "It is finished" (John 19:30), and also echoes a
                        similar proclamation in Revelation 16:17 ("It is done!" at the final bowl judgment). Here the context is
                        the completion of God's redemptive plan: the new creation and eternal order are established. In
                        Greek, it's essentially "They have come to pass" - all these promises and prophecies are now reality.
                        History has reached its appointed culmination. For the believer, these words are thrilling: our
                        salvation and sanctification are brought to full completion by God's power, not our own. What God
                        started in Genesis is now "done" in Revelation. There's a sense of finality and fulfillment. No more
                        suspense about the future - God's plan is fully realized. This conveys God's sovereignty over time; He
                        can speak of future things as accomplished facts.</li>
                    <li>"I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end." Alpha and Omega are the first and last
                        letters of the Greek alphabet. God is saying, "I am the A to Z of everything." He is the Originator of
                        creation and the Consummator of creation. This title was used of the Lord God in Revelation 1:8 and
                        22:13, as well as of Christ (who shares God's titles). It emphasizes God's eternal nature and absolute
                        authority over all things. All reality begins with Him and ends with Him. For a personal application:
                        our lives find meaning when centered on the Alpha and Omega. If God is the beginning and end,
                        then all purpose and truth start and finish with Him. It also comforts us that nothing in our life is
                        outside His knowledge or control He's already at the "end" of our story as surely as at the
                        beginning. We can trust Him from start to finish.</li>
                    <li>"I will give to him who thirsts from the fountain of the water of life freely." Here God issues a
                        gracious promise (almost an invitation, akin to Revelation 22:17). The water of life symbolizes eternal
                        life and ultimate satisfaction in God. In the Middle East, fountains of living (fresh) water are a source
                        of life. Spiritually, God is the source of life-giving water. Jesus told the Samaritan woman about
                        "living water" that leads to eternal life (John 4:14) and later cried out, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to
                        Me and drink" (John 7:37). The thirst spoken of is the yearning of the human soul for salvation, for
                        God Himself. The beautiful thing here is God's assurance that He will freely give this water to all who
                        desire it. "Freely" means as a gift, without cost. Salvation in Christ is without money and without
                        price (Isaiah 55:1 "come, buy wine and milk without money"). In eternity, the fullness of this
                        promise is experienced: all the redeemed have drunk from the spring of God's grace and are
                        continuously refreshed by Him.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This line may also serve as a final gospel call in the book: anyone who is spiritually thirsty is invited to come
                    even now. God's heart is to give life, not withhold it. What an encouragement - our God is a generous God. In
                    heaven, we will eternally drink of His goodness (Psalm 36:8-9 says God's people "drink from the river of Your
                    pleasures; for with You is the fountain of life").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: Are you spiritually thirsty? Jesus promised, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst
                    for righteousness, for they shall be filled" (Matthew 5:6). God delights to satisfy our deepest needs. Even
                    today, we drink of the water of life by coming to Christ in faith and receiving the Holy Spirit (see John
                    7:38-39). And in eternity, that satisfaction will be complete. This also challenges us: the offer is free, but one
                    must recognize their thirst and come. Pride or love of sin can keep someone from admitting their need. But
                    God assures that anyone who comes will receive life abundantly. Revelation 21:6, therefore, brims with the
                    grace of God. Salvation is accomplished ("It is done"), provided by the Eternal One, and offered freely to all
                    who will take it.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:7 - "He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son."</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be My son." (21:7)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This verse describes the portion of the redeemed in terms of inheritance and relationship. It echoes
                    promises Christ made earlier in Revelation and in the epistles:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"He that overcomes" - In Revelation chapters 2-3, each letter to the seven churches ended with a
                        promise "to him who overcomes" (or conquers). To overcome, in John's writings, essentially means to
                        remain faithful to Christ by faith, overcoming sin, the world, and falsehood (1 John 5:4-5 says, "Who is
                        he that overcomes the world, but he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?"). In other words,
                        "overcomer" = true believer who endures to the end by the power of Christ. It does not imply a
                        special elite class of Christian; rather, every true Christian is an overcomer (through Christ's
                        victory). Here, at the end of the story, we see what the overcomer receives.</li>
                    <li>"shall inherit all things" - Some manuscripts read "inherit these things" (meaning the blessings
                        just described). In any case, the promise is that the victor will receive the full inheritance God has
                        prepared. And what is "all things"? It doesn't mean we become little gods, but it does mean every
                        blessing of God's kingdom becomes ours to enjoy. We will inherit the new heavens and new earth
                        (just as the meek inherit the earth). Romans 8:17 calls us "heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ."
                        Imagine: everything Christ receives by divine right, He shares with us by grace! The overcomer
                        inherits the very presence of God, eternal life, glory, the kingdom, and all its riches. This fulfills
                        scriptures like Psalm 37: "The righteous shall inherit the land and dwell in it forever" (Ps 37:29). It's the
                        ultimate reversal of the curse - whereas man once lost his inheritance through sin, now in Christ we
                        regain not just Eden, but far more. Ephesians 1:18 prays we grasp "the riches of the glory of His
                        inheritance in the saints." Here it's plainly stated: God's children get it all not one good thing
                        withheld.</li>
                    <li>"I will be his God and he shall be My son." - Here God promises relationship using intimate terms.
                        It's the language of adoption and family. In the Old Testament, God spoke of Israel collectively as
                        His son (e.g. Hosea 11:1, "Out of Egypt I called My son"). But now this promise is personal: "he"
                        (individual) shall be My son. Through Christ, we are adopted as sons and daughters of God
                        (Galatians 4:5-7, Ephesians 1:5). That status is realized fully in eternity: God openly claims us as His
                        children, and we enjoy all the love and privilege of being in His family. 1 John 3:1 says, "Behold what
                        manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God!" This was always
                        God's desire - to raise up human sons and daughters in His image. Now it's come true forever. And "I
                        will be his God" repeats the covenant refrain, but adding "son" intensifies the closeness. We are not
                        just "people" under God's rule; we are children in the Father's house. In fact, Romans 8:19 speaks
                        of the coming glory as "the revealing of the sons of God." Here it is revealed.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The combination of inheritance and sonship is significant. In human terms, it is sons (or children) who
                    inherit the estate of the father. So God is saying: because you are My son, you will inherit My estate - which is
                    essentially "all things." What a staggering inheritance! No wonder Paul wrote, "All things are yours... and you
                    are Christ's, and Christ is God's" (1 Corinthians 3:21-23).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: This promise motivates us to persevere. The overcomer is the one who doesn't
                    abandon faith when tested. Knowing what's at stake everything! we can endure hardship. As Jesus
                    encouraged, "To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne" (Rev 3:21). No trial or sacrifice in
                    this life compares to the reward to come. Also, this assures us of God's love: He wants us as sons and
                    daughters. Even now, "the Spirit bears witness... that we are children of God" (Rom 8:16). We should walk in
                    dignity and obedience, reflecting our Father's character. And when we stumble, remember that a loving
                    Father disciplines and restores us - He won't disown those truly in Christ. If we belong to Jesus, our future is
                    secure: God has spoken, "You are Mine; you will inherit it all."

                    brimstone: which is the second death." (21:8)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the soaring promises to the overcomers, verse 8 gives a sober contrast. Not everyone will be in this
                    glorious new creation. This verse serves as a warning: those who remain in sin and unbelief - who do not
                    overcome face a tragic destiny, namely the "second death" in the lake of fire. This was mentioned in
                    Revelation 20:14-15 (the lake of fire is where Death, Hades, the devil, and all whose names were not in the
                    Book of Life were thrown, "the second death"). Now it specifically lists categories of those excluded from the
                    Holy City and instead cast into eternal judgment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list includes:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cowardly (fearful) - meaning those who shrink back from confessing Christ or living by faith due to
                        fear. In context, possibly those who caved in to pressures under persecution or took the mark of the beast
                        out of fear. It's a sobering inclusion: moral cowardice (when it reflects a lack of genuine trust in God) can be
                        soul-destroying. Compare Jesus' words: "Whoever is ashamed of Me... the Son of Man will be ashamed of
                        him" (Mark 8:38).</li>
                    <li>The unbelieving - those who refuse to trust in God or His gospel. Unbelief is a root sin; it cuts one off
                        from salvation (John 3:18, "he who does not believe is condemned already").</li>
                    <li>The abominable people polluted by abominations, i.e. gross evil, perhaps including things like occult
                        practices or extreme moral filth.</li>
                    <li>Murderers - those who unjustly take life (and by Jesus' standard, even harboring hateful anger is murder
                        in seed form).</li>
                    <li>Sexually immoral (fornicators) - those indulging in sexual sin (porneia in Greek covers all sexual activity
                        outside God's design of marriage). In our age, sexual immorality is rampant and even celebrated, but God's
                        word consistently warns it leads to exclusion from His kingdom (Ephesians 5:5).</li>
                    <li>Sorcerers those practicing witchcraft, magic arts, or drug-induced occult experiences (the Greek
                        pharmakoi implies use of potions/drugs in magical practices).</li>
                    <li>Idolaters - worshipers of anything other than the true God. This can be overt (pagan religion) or covert
                        (greed is called idolatry in Colossians 3:5).</li>
                    <li>All liars - those who live in falsehood and deceit. The inclusion of "all liars" reminds us that even sins we
                        consider "small" (like lying) have no place in God's perfect kingdom. Satan is the father of lies; God's city is
                        the home of truth, so none who love lies will enter.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This catalog is similar to other New Testament lists (see 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21) which warn
                    that "those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God." It doesn't mean a true Christian who once
                    fell into a lie or act of immorality is automatically lost; rather, it describes those who persist in these sins and
                    never turn in repentance to Christ. Their lives are characterized by these things rather than by faith and
                    overcoming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For such, their "part" (portion) is not in the New Jerusalem but in the lake of fire and brimstone. This is the
                    final hell, a place of eternal separation from God's goodness, described as burning fire (and brimstone, i.e.
                    sulfur) - imagery of terrible, unending judgment (see Mark 9:48, "their worm does not die and the fire is not
                    quenched"). It is called the second death because it is the eternal death that follows physical death for
                    those not redeemed. Physical death separates soul from body; the second death is the final separation of
                    the person from God's life. It's eternal dying without ever ceasing to exist or finding relief.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This verse is a solemn reminder: Heaven is real, but so is hell. In the midst of comforting promises, God
                    makes sure we understand that the New Earth is a holy realm nothing unclean enters (as verse 27 will
                    reiterate). Those who choose sin over the Savior will tragically get what they chose a destiny apart from
                    God, which is only darkness and anguish.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Reflection: This should stir us to holy fear and evangelism. First, it challenges us to examine
                    ourselves: Am I among "the unbelieving" or "the cowardly"? Have I truly put my faith in Christ and repented
                    of these sins? True believers can still stumble, but they will ultimately overcome and not be defined by
                    these sins (1 Cor 6:11, "such were some of you, but you were washed..."). If you see these patterns ruling
                    your life, flee to Jesus now for forgiveness and transformation! Second, it should give us compassion and
                    urgency for others. People around us who don't know Christ are described by some term in that list. We
                    have the message that can save them from the second death. God "is not willing that any should perish" <sup>2</sup>
                    Peter 3:9), which is why He sent Jesus. Let's be faithful to warn and woo people with the gospel. Verse 8,
                    though heavy, is actually an expression of God's justice and truth - the very things that make the New World
                    so good are the things that judge unrepentant evil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the placement of this warning right after the magnificent promises reminds us: every human
                    being has two possible destinies. There is no middle ground. Either one becomes an overcomer by faith
                    and inherits all things as God's child, or one clings to sin and unbelief and receives a share in the lake of fire.
                    "Choose this day whom you will serve" (Josh 24:15) has eternal significance. But thanks be to God, today is the
                    day of salvation and the invitation to drink freely of the water of life (v.6) is still open as long as it's called
                    "today."
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:9-10 - Vision of the Bride, the Lamb's Wife (the Holy City descends)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues,
                    and talked with me, saying, 'Come hither, I will show thee the bride, the Lamb's wife.' And he carried me away in
                    the spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of
                    heaven from God." (21:9-10)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    At verse 9, we essentially begin a new section of the vision (as noted in the introduction). One of the bowl-
                    judgment angels approaches John to reveal more about the bride of the Lamb. This scene deliberately
                    parallels Revelation 17:1, where a bowl-angel said, "Come, I will show you...the judgment of the great harlot
                    (Babylon)." Here the angel says, "Come, I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife." The contrast is striking and
                    intentional <sup>35</sup> <sup>36</sup>. Previously, John saw the prostitute Babylon (symbol of godless worldly culture) and her
                    destruction. Now he is shown the pure bride (the community of God's people) and her eternal glory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The angel takes John "in the Spirit" to a vantage point: a high mountain, from which he can see the Holy City
                    descending out of heaven from God (just as John had seen in verse 2). This likely is the same descent as in
                    verse 2, but now we zoom in to explore the city in detail. However, recall that from the Brethren/
                    dispensational perspective, verses 9 and following describe the city particularly in relation to the
                    millennial earth (the 1000-year reign). William Kelly notes that the angel is showing John the bride in her
                    millennial display "the Holy Ghost goes back to describe the same New Jerusalem, with reference to the
                    millennial reign, and the kings and nations then on earth." <sup>9</sup> <sup>37</sup>. Edward Dennett also explains that verse
                    10's scene is "prior by a thousand years" to the scene of verse 2 - meaning John is now seeing the city during
                    the Millennium, reigning from heaven over the earth <sup>38</sup>. This is supported by details in verses 24-26
                    (nations, kings, etc.). So what John sees from the mountain is the New Jerusalem in its role as the
                    metropolis of Christ's Kingdom, hovering in the sky ("descending from heaven") radiating glory to the
                    earth. (One might think of it as a satellite city or the "capital" of the renewed world under Christ's reign,
                    accessible perhaps to earth's inhabitants in some way.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's highlight some points:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The bride, the Lamb's wife" = "that great city, the holy Jerusalem." The angel says he will show
                        the bride (Christ's wife), and John looks and sees a city. This directly identifies the two: the city is the
                        bride in symbolic terms <sup>39</sup>. It's a reminder that in prophecy, a "city" often symbolizes its people.
                        Here, the brilliance and structure of New Jerusalem represents the redeemed community in glory.
                        Just as Babylon was both a city and a representation of a wicked society, so New Jerusalem is both a
                        literal place and representation of God's holy people. John is effectively seeing the Church (and
                        redeemed) glorified. Earlier, in Revelation 19:7-8, the bride made herself ready and was arrayed in
                        fine linen (righteous deeds). Now we see the corporate bride as a beautiful city prepared by God.</li>
                    <li>"Carried me... to a great and high mountain." In Scripture, significant visions of future Jerusalem
                        often involve being on a high mountain (Ezekiel 40:2, where a man shows Ezekiel the future temple
                        from a high mountain; also perhaps reminiscent of Moses viewing Canaan from Mount Nebo). A
                        high vantage indicates importance and allows John (and us) to take in the vastness of the city.</li>
                    <li>"Descending out of heaven from God." This repeats verse 2; it signifies that the city's origin and
                        character are heavenly and divine. During the Millennium, the thought is that this city is hovering
                        above the earthly Jerusalem (some believe New Jerusalem might remain in the air, a celestial city
                        lighting the earth). Scripture hints the Church's dwelling is "heavenly places" even in the kingdom
                        age. For example, Ephesians 2:6 says we are seated in heavenly places in Christ. Some
                        dispensational teachers (like J.N. Darby) have described New Jerusalem as the "heavenly metropolis"
                        of the millennial kingdom <sup>40</sup>. Darby wrote that in this vision "It is the assembly [Church] as founded on
                        the twelve [apostles] - the organized seat of heavenly power, the new and now heavenly capital of God's
                        government" <sup>40</sup>. So, during Christ's reign, the New Jerusalem is the capital city of the universe,
                        connecting heaven and earth. The nations on earth walk in its light (v.24).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: Seeing the Church pictured as a glorious city should fill us with awe and a sense of
                    purpose. God is constructing His people into something of unspeakable beauty and order (Ephesians
                    2:19-22 compares the Church to a building, a temple for God). Today, we may see the Church in her
                    weakness and blemishes, but God sees the finished product: radiant and solid as a jewel-city. It reminds us
                    that our faith isn't individualistic only - we are being built together with all the saints. One day we'll be part
                    of this perfected community shining for Christ. That encourages us to love the Church now, serve in it, and
                    strive for purity as part of the bride. Also, the title "the Lamb's wife" reminds us of the price of our
                    redemption - we belong to the Lamb who was slain for us. We are His beloved. The splendor of the city is all
                    due to the Lamb's work. Thus all our glory will be to His glory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In verses 9-10, we've set the stage: John is about to describe the city/bride in detail. It is enormous, dazzling,
                    and full of symbolism. Every feature speaks of God's glory and His redeemed people's perfection. As we
                    proceed, keep in mind both the literal grandeur and the spiritual meanings these details convey about our
                    future with God.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:11 - "Having the glory of God, her light like a jasper stone, clear as crystal."</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as
                    crystal." (21:11)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The first thing John notices about New Jerusalem is the radiant glory shining from it. The city has the glory
                    of God meaning the very presence and brilliance of God's own glory fills and emanates from her. In
                    Scripture, God's glory is often manifested as overwhelming light (e.g. the Shekinah glory cloud in Solomon's
                    temple, 1 Kings 8:11). Here, the entire city is suffused with that divine light. It is as if God's character and
                    splendor have permeated His people completely, fulfilling Jesus' word that the righteous will shine like the
                    sun in the kingdom of their Father (Matthew 13:43).
                </p>
                <p>
                    John tries to describe the appearance: "her light was like a most precious stone, like jasper, clear as crystal."
                    Earlier in Revelation 4:3, God on the throne was described as looking like jasper and sardius stone. Jasper
                    in ancient terms is likely not the opaque jasper we know today, but rather a translucent gem possibly
                    similar to diamond or a brilliantly shining jewel. John calls it "most precious" and "clear as crystal." This
                    suggests the city gleams like a giant sparkling diamond, flashing the colors of God's glory. Imagine pure
                    light refracting through a flawless gemstone the city's light is like that. And note: it's not reflecting an
                    external light; the glory of God within her is the light (verse 23 will say the Lamb is its lamp). So this is
                    inherent glory from God's presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In practical terms, this means the Church (the bride-city) fully reflects God's character (holiness, beauty) and
                    is filled with His presence. When Moses spent time with God, his face shone (Exodus 34:29); how much more
                    will the entire community of the redeemed shine after being in God's immediate presence! Jesus prayed in
                    John 17:22, "The glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one." That
                    prayer finds ultimate fulfillment here: we share in Christ's glory (not His deity, of course, but His moral and
                    resurrected glory).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jasper, clear as crystal: Jasper could indicate a crystal-green shining (some say ancient jasper was
                    greenish). Whether it's green or diamond-like, later in verse 18 jasper is also said to be the material of the
                    city's wall, explicitly called "pure... like clear glass." So likely a transparent crystalline substance. In any case,
                    John's impression is of brilliant clarity, purity, and priceless beauty. Nothing is murky or dim. The city is
                    full of light with no impurity to obscure it. "Clear as crystal" speaks of absolute purity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: Jesus said "You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden" (Matt 5:14).
                    The New Jerusalem is literally a city of light on the highest hill (mountain). Our destiny is to shine with
                    God's glory. Even now, we should reflect His light in a dark world, though imperfectly. Philippians 2:15
                    encourages us to be "blameless... shining as lights in the world." One day, all imperfections will be gone and
                    we'll shine crystal-clear. What an incentive to pursue purity now! Also, consider that all this light isn't
                    originating from us - it is God's glory in us. So all credit goes to Him. Believers won't be boasting of their
                    own righteousness in heaven; we'll be radiating the righteousness and beauty that He gave us. It's a gift of
                    grace that we share in His glory. That should humble us and fill us with gratitude.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, think of the contrast: the harlot Babylon in Rev 17 was decked in gold and jewels too, but it was a
                    gaudy, impure glitter - and she was full of abominations (Rev 17:4). New Jerusalem has true jewels (as we'll
                    see) but more importantly has God's glory, pure and clear. It's the difference between worldly glamour
                    (external, corrupt) and godly glory (internal, holy). We as the Church are called even now to renounce
                    Babylon's false glitter and embrace the true light of holiness. For "if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we
                    have fellowship with one another" (1 John 1:7). In eternity, that fellowship in light is complete and unbroken.

                <h2>Revelation 21:12-14 - The Great Wall, Twelve Gates, and Twelve Foundations</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And [the city] had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names
                    written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: on the east three gates; on the
                    north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. And the wall of the city had twelve
                    foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.**" (21:12-14)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    John now describes the structure of the New Jerusalem. It has a massive wall with gates, and foundations
                    undergirding the wall. The number twelve dominates the description symbolizing completeness,
                    especially the people of God. Twelve was the number of Israel's tribes and also Christ's apostles. Here we
                    have both, indicating the unity and continuity of God's people across covenants.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"a wall great and high" In the ancient world, city walls provided security and defined the city's
                        extent. This wall being "great and high" shows the city is perfectly secure (no threat can breach it)
                        and clearly delineated as a special, holy place. Spiritually, it signifies eternal security and separation
                        from all evil (verse 27 will say nothing defiling enters). One commentator says the symbolic meaning
                        of the wall is security, guaranteed by God's own glory as the wall's material <sup>41</sup>. Indeed, since the
                        wall is made of jasper (v.18), essentially the wall is the shining glory of God - what better protection!
                        We can think of Isaiah 26:1, "We have a strong city; God makes salvation its walls and bulwarks." The
                        saved are "walled in" by God's salvation itself.</li>
                    <li>"twelve gates... and at the gates twelve angels" - The city has 12 entry points (gates), three on
                        each side (East, North, South, West - reminiscent of how Israel's camp in the wilderness had three
                        tribes camped on each side of the tabernacle, Numbers 2). The equal distribution shows the city is
                        oriented in all directions - open to people from every direction of the earth (north, south, east, west
                        an echo of how the redeemed come from all directions, Luke 13:29). Each gate has an angel
                        stationed, perhaps as an honor guard or gatekeeper (angels often guard holy places - e.g. cherubim
                        at Eden's gate in Gen 3:24). But unlike Eden, these gates are not to keep redeemed people out (they
                        are actually open perpetually, v.25); rather the angels at the gates could be a ceremonial
                        acknowledgment of God's authority and welcome to the righteous <sup>42</sup>.</li>
                    <li>"names... of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel" - Each gate is inscribed with the name of
                        one of Israel's tribes (probably one name per gate). This powerfully signifies that the heritage of
                        Israel is integral to the city. Jesus said in John 4:22, "salvation is of the Jews." God began His
                        redemptive community with the 12 tribes, and through Israel came the Messiah. These names on
                        gates show that no one enters the city apart from the groundwork laid through Israel's covenant
                        and promises. In fact, in the Millennium, Israel will be the lead nation on earth, and here, even in the
                        eternal/glorified sense, Israel's honor is memorialized. One might recall that in Ezekiel's vision of the
                        future earthly Jerusalem (Ezekiel 48:30-35), the city gates were likewise named after the 12 tribes of
                        Israel. So God keeps Israel's identity in an everlasting way. Brethren expositors also see a millennial
                        meaning: that the government of the kingdom is administered in connection to Israel. Dennett
                        notes that having 12 gates (and 12 angels) implies perfect administration of justice and
                        government, with the names of Israel's tribes denoting the kingdom's administration "through Israel
                        as a center" during the Millennium <sup>43</sup> <sup>44</sup>. In other words, in Christ's kingdom, Israel is the head of
                        the nations; the Church (in the heavenly city) is reigning with Christ; and righteous angels serve - all
                        cooperating in God's government. The picture is one of divine order and inclusion of all God's people.</li>
                    <li>"twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb." - The wall
                        isn't just one layer; it has 12 foundational layers, each inscribed with the name of one of Christ's
                        apostles. This is a vivid symbol that the Church (built on the apostolic gospel) is foundational in
                        God's city. It fulfills Ephesians 2:20, which says believers "are built on the foundation of the apostles and
                        prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone." Here Jesus as cornerstone isn't mentioned
                        (He's the Lamb, the light, etc., in the city), but the apostles' names on foundations tell us that their
                        testimony of Christ - the gospel - is what this entire community is built upon. The fact there are 12
                        apostles named likely presumes Matthias (who replaced Judas) or Paul included; the exact identities
                        aside, it's the concept of the apostolic foundation of the Church. The word "apostles of the Lamb"
                        emphasizes these were Christ's direct messengers, the ones who brought the Lamb's salvation
                        message.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Having both tribes of Israel and apostles of the Church inscribed in the city's architecture shows the unity
                    of all God's people. It's like Revelation is saying: This city is the home of the Old Testament saints (represented by
                    tribes) and New Testament saints (represented by apostles). Hebrews 11:10,16 said the faithful saints awaited a
                    "city prepared by God" - here it is, for all the faithful. It also beautifully demonstrates that God has been
                    building this "city/people" through both covenants of history. Hebrews 12:22-23 says "you have come to
                    Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the
                    general assembly and church of the firstborn..." - it's a gathering of all redeemed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a dispensational Brethren perspective, they would add that in the Millennial phase, the mention of
                    tribes and apostles underscores the administrative roles: Israel (tribes) as the channel of earthly rule (the
                    gates of the city connecting to earth's governance) and the Church (apostles) as the administrative
                    foundation of the heavenly rule <sup>45</sup> <sup>40</sup>. As Dennett says, "the church, the Lamb's wife, is displayed... in
                    connection with the government of the earth in the hands of Christ during the thousand years" <sup>45</sup>. In that
                    display, the number 12 (tribes/apostles) shows the perfection of government in and through God's people
                    <sup>46</sup>. The apostles judging the 12 tribes (as Jesus promised in Matt 19:28) might be implied.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Angels and subordination: Dennett interestingly remarks that the angels at the gates, who used to
                        be God's primary agents in running the world, are now gladly subordinate to the glorified saints in
                        the city <sup>47</sup>. They serve as "doorkeepers" of the great city, while the saints reign. This aligns with 1
                        Corinthians 6:3, "Do you not know that we shall judge angels?" - not in punishing sense, but ruling
                        above them in hierarchy. Yet all in harmony under Christ.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: The inclusion of both Israel and the Church in the city's design encourages humility
                    and harmony among God's people. There is no "Old vs New" or "Jew vs Gentile" division in the end - all are
                    part of God's one glorious people, differentiated yet unified. God's promises to Israel were not forgotten;
                    and the labor of the apostles was not in vain - both are memorialized forever. For us, this means we ought
                    to appreciate the whole counsel of God Old and New Testaments and the heritage of faith that came
                    before us. We are part of a big family. Also, the foundations being the apostles hints that what we have
                    now in Scripture (the apostolic teaching) is foundational. If we want to live as citizens of that city, we must
                    stay true to the apostolic gospel (Galatians 1:8-9). The Church today is "the pillar and ground of the truth" (1
                    Tim 3:15) only so far as it stands on the foundation already laid by Christ and His apostles. Finally, consider
                    the names on gates and foundations. God knows His own by name. He has named sections of His city after
                    His people what an honor! This reflects His personal love and the fact that our identities and stories are
                    precious to Him. Your name may not be on a foundation stone, but Jesus did promise to write the
                    overcomer's name on God's city (Rev 3:12). He includes us in His eternal story. That should inspire us to
                    honor His name here on earth.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:15-17 - The City's Measurements (Perfect Symmetry)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall
                    thereof. And the city lies foursquare, and its length is as large as the breadth. And he measured the city with the
                    reed: twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. And he measured the
                    wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel."
                    (21:15-17)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The angel now measures the city, much as Ezekiel saw an angel measure the new temple (Ezek 40-42) and
                    as John himself once measured the tribulation temple (Rev 11:1). Measuring in prophetic visions often
                    symbolizes that God is claiming ownership of something and showing its perfection and security <sup>48</sup>.
                    Here, the measuring serves to convey the city's immense size and perfect proportions:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The angel uses a golden reed (a measuring rod). Gold indicates the dignity and perhaps divine
                        standard of this measurement it's an official, righteous measurement (not arbitrary) <sup>48</sup>. The
                        phrase "according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel" suggests that the measurements
                        given, though made by an angel, are in human terms we can understand (the angel didn't use some
                        otherworldly scale; it's translatable to our measurements).</li>
                    <li>Shape of the city: "The city lies foursquare, its length as large as the breadth... the length and
                        breadth and height are equal." This describes a cube or possibly a pyramid (some suggest maybe a
                        pyramid could fit, but "length = breadth = height" most naturally implies a cube). A cube is a shape of
                        perfection and stability. Importantly, the Holy of Holies in the temple was a cube (1 Kings 6:20 - 20
                        cubits each dimension). So the entire city is like one gigantic Holy of Holies the place of God's
                        presence. This reinforces that God's presence fills the city and every part of it is most holy.</li>
                    <li>Dimensions: "Twelve thousand furlongs" A furlong (stadion in Greek) is about 600 feet (185
                        meters). 12,000 stadia would be roughly 1,380 miles (2,220 km). In other words, ~1,400 miles in
                        length, width, and height! To put in perspective: that's about the distance from New York City to
                        Houston, or from London to Athens. A square of that size would cover nearly half of the continental
                        United States, or most of Europe. And then it extends upward 1,400 miles high - far beyond Earth's
                        atmosphere. Clearly this is vast. These numbers might be symbolic (12,000 has 12 and 1000,
                        numbers of completeness and magnitude), but even if so, it indicates the city can easily
                        accommodate all God's people and more. There's no lack of space or resources in God's eternal
                        home. Jesus said "In My Father's house are many mansions" (John 14:2) - indeed, an immense plenty!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Whether literal or symbolic, the enormity tells us of the majesty. And if literal, God could create a new earth
                    and new physics to support such a structure. Nothing is impossible in the new creation. Some interpret that
                    perhaps the city could be more of a mountain shape (pyramidal), but text says equal in all dimensions,
                    favoring a cube.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wall thickness/height: John says the wall was 144 cubits by the angel's measure. 144 cubits is about
                        216 feet (around 66 meters). It's a bit unclear: is that the wall's thickness or height? Some think
                        height, but 216 feet seems short compared to a 1,400-mile high city! More likely it's the thickness (or
                        the height of the wall proper if the city rises like a cube above it). In any case, "144" is 12 x 12 - again
                        the number of fullness (probably indicating the wall is perfectly sufficient). If it's thickness, a 216-foot
                        thick wall is extremely secure. If height, it shows the wall is dwarfed by the city's own height,
                        implying the wall primarily serves symbolic purpose (since no enemy is around to climb anyway in
                        eternity).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    One commentary suggests the measurement affirms God's approval: the golden reed measuring the city is
                    like God declaring "this is exactly right" <sup>48</sup>. Indeed, it says the measured result was a perfect cube. This
                    perfection is not accidental; it reflects God's design. The symmetry (length = breadth = height) suggests
                    perfection, completeness, harmony. Everything about salvation will be perfectly balanced and
                    proportionate. The city is the ultimate "holy of holies" where we all dwell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: These measurements can blow our mind, but spiritually we can draw a couple lessons.
                    One, God's kingdom is spacious - there is room for all who will come. We don't have to fear that heaven
                    will run out of space or blessings. It's an infinite, abundant inheritance (Heb 11:16, God prepared a city for
                    them not just a cottage). Two, precision and order characterize God's work. Our future is not a nebulous
                    cloud of existence, but something tangible and beautifully ordered. This speaks to God's nature - He brings
                    order, design, and clarity. Believers can trust that even now God is measuring and fitting us into His spiritual
                    house (Eph 2:21). We are living stones being shaped for our place. Sometimes His chisel hurts, but He has a
                    precise purpose, to fit us into the structure. Finally, note that the measurement was "according to man's
                    measure." The idea is that God wants us to comprehend (as much as possible) the greatness of this city.
                    He communicates in terms we can grasp (even if only in awe). This tells me that God wants us to anticipate
                    and long for this reality. Reading these specifics should make heaven feel more concrete, not just a vague
                    hope. It's real, measured, built by God. Thus our hope is anchored in something solid and not fanciful.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:18-21 - Materials of Construction: Gold and Precious Stones</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. And the
                    foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
                    jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald; the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the
                    seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth,
                    amethyst. And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city
                    was pure gold, as it were transparent glass." (21:18-21)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now the materials of the city are described, and they are astonishingly rich and symbolic. Essentially, the
                    city is composed of pure gold and precious gems. This shows the extreme value and beauty God has
                    invested in His people. It also fulfills Old Testament imagery: for example, Isaiah 54:11-12 (addressing
                    restored Jerusalem) says, "I will lay your stones with colorful gems, and lay your foundations with sapphires. I
                    will make your pinnacles of rubies, your gates of crystal, and all your walls of precious stones." That poetic
                    promise is literally realized in New Jerusalem.

                    Key details:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wall of Jasper: As earlier noted, jasper here is a crystal-like gem, likely shining clear or in hues. The
                        entire wall is made of this gem (so imagine a huge transparent, radiant wall). Jasper represented
                        God's glory in 4:3; so the wall being jasper <sup>41</sup> means the glory of God is what encloses and protects
                        the city. It is also beautiful to behold, refracting light.</li>
                    <li>City of pure gold, like clear glass: The city itself its buildings or streets are made of gold so
                        pure it is translucent. We think of gold as opaque, but in this glorified state it's as if the gold is
                        crystal-clear while still gold-colored ("like transparent glass"). This indicates utmost purity; no
                        impurity in the gold. Gold in Scripture often symbolizes what is divine or kingship or precious; here
                        the very fabric of the city is divine in quality and absolutely pure. It also suggests that the city is
                        filled with light that can pass through (nothing murky). F.B. Hole notes that the street being gold
                        and transparent means the daily walk and commerce of the city is utterly holy and open <sup>49</sup> <sup>50</sup> - no
                        hidden dark corners. All is righteousness (gold) and truth (clear).</li>
                    <li>Foundations adorned with precious stones: Each of the 12 foundation layers of the wall is
                        decorated with a different gem. John lists twelve gemstones: jasper, sapphire, chalcedony, emerald,
                        sardonyx, sardius (carnelian), chrysolite, beryl, topaz, chrysoprase, jacinth, amethyst. Many of these
                        correspond to the stones on the High Priest's breastplate (Exodus 28:17-20) which had 12 stones for
                        the 12 tribes <sup>51</sup> <sup>52</sup>. Not exactly the same list/order (some differences in naming), but the parallel is
                        clear. The high priest bore Israel's tribes as gems on his chest into God's presence, indicating they
                        were precious to God. Here, likewise, God's people are represented as precious jewels forming the
                        city's foundation. Some commentators see significance in each stone's color: together they would
                        produce a magnificent spectrum - maybe like a rainbow encircling the city's base <sup>53</sup> <sup>54</sup>. A 19th-
                        century source (likely the Pulpit Commentary) notes these stones shining together would be "like a
                        rainbow belt" around the city <sup>55</sup>. This reminds of God's glory and promise (the rainbow around His
                        throne, Rev 4:3). Also, the variety of gems implies the manifold, varied graces and individual beauty
                        of the saints unity (all foundations shine together) but diversity (different gems). As one put it:
                        "harmony, not monotony; variety, not sameness; unity, not uniformity" <sup>56</sup>. The Church is composed of
                        people of different hues, all glorified. Each apostolic foundation had its distinct stone, perhaps
                        reflecting the labor of each apostle and those saved through their ministry shining forever.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Spiritually, gems are formed under heat and pressure - one could say the trials and refining of God's people
                    produce gem-like Christlike character, which will adorn eternity. Malachi 3:17, God says of His people, "They
                    shall be Mine... in that day when I make up My jewels." Truly here He has made them up in a wall!
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Twelve Gates = Twelve Pearls: This is one of the most famous images - the "pearly gates." Each
                        gate is a single enormous pearl. Pearls in nature are formed through suffering (an oyster covers an
                        irritant with layers of nacre, building a pearl). Some have drawn analogy that the pearl is a product
                        of pain - perhaps reflecting that our access to God (the gates) was made by Christ's suffering, and
                        even the church's suffering in Christ. Indeed, a parable of Jesus compares the kingdom to "a pearl of
                        great price" that a merchant sold all to purchase (Matt 13:45-46). Brethren commentators see that
                        parable as Christ giving all to redeem the Church, the pearl <sup>57</sup> <sup>58</sup>. Dennett explicitly says: "the pearl
                        speaks of what is attractive to the heart of Christ - a beauty which ravished Him, so that He loved the
                        church and gave Himself for it" <sup>57</sup> <sup>58</sup>. How fitting, then, that each gate - an entrance point - is a
                        giant pearl: symbol of Christ's redemption and the priceless value of His people for whom He paid all
                        <sup>57</sup>. Every time one "enters" or beholds the city, one is reminded of the Lamb's sacrifice that made it
                        possible, and of how cherished the saints are to Him. Also, a gate being one pearl suggests unity
                        (each gate is single, whole possibly hinting one way of salvation).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Additionally, pearls were highly valued (one of the most valuable ancient gems). So this adds to the picture
                    that everything in this city is of extreme worth.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Street of pure gold, transparent like glass: Often cited is "streets of gold." Interestingly it says
                        "street" (singular) - possibly a broad way or the general thoroughfare. It being pure gold and
                        transparent reiterates verse 18's point. The transparency likely means that even this most opaque of
                        metals is as pure and clear as glass in heaven. There's no impurity or anything to hide. The whole
                        environment is full of light and holiness.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Symbolic significance: Gold in the Bible can represent divine nature or glory, and precious stones
                    represent the beauty of God's work in believers (see 1 Cor 3:12 where our works that last are compared to
                    gold, silver, precious stones). So one might see the gold city as the divine life permeating everything, and
                    the multi-colored gems as the graces of the saints reflecting God's light. The pearls at gates symbolize the
                    work of Christ as the entry to glory. Thus doctrinally: we enter by Christ's sacrifice (pearls), built on the
                    foundation of apostolic truth (the jeweled foundations with apostles' names), and are filled with God's glory
                    (gold and jasper). It's a cohesive picture of salvation's outcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also consider: what is most precious to us now (gold, jewels) are mere building materials in heaven. That
                    shows how vastly greater the value system is. God's presence and holiness are the true riches; gold and
                    gems are just the asphalt and drywall, so to speak, of our eternal home! It emphasizes that what we count
                    precious here is commonplace there - an encouragement not to idolize earthly wealth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: This lavish description should stir worship in our hearts. If God so adorned the city,
                    how much more beautiful must be the One who prepared it! It also reminds us that we are God's precious
                    jewels in the making. Do we view fellow believers as jewels for whom Christ gave all? It should inspire love
                    and respect in the community. Moreover, the pearl gates tell us that the only way in is through Christ's
                    sacrifice. There were no pearls on the high priest's breastplate - pearls are unique in that they come from a
                    living creature's suffering. The church is that unique jewel from Christ's suffering. We must always cling to
                    the cross as our entrance into every blessing. Even in heaven, the basis of our presence there will forever be
                    the Lamb's work (we'll see in 22:1 the Lamb on the throne).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the transparency speaks to living in total honesty and purity. Even now, "if we walk in the light as He is
                    in the light... the blood of Jesus cleanses us" (1 John 1:7). Let's practice that transparent, golden living
                    genuine faith and holiness - knowing that's our destiny.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:22-23 - No Temple, God and the Lamb are its Temple; No Sun or Moon, God's Glory is Light</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it. And the city had
                    no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light
                    thereof." (21:22-23)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These verses highlight what is absent in the city things that were crucial in the old world but are
                    superseded now by God's immediate presence.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No temple in the city: This is significant because in the present/historical Jerusalem, the temple was
                        the very center of worship. In Ezekiel's future prophecy of a millennial earth, there is a temple. But in
                        New Jerusalem, no temple building exists. Why? "For the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its
                        temple." In other words, God Himself (Father and Son, implied by "Lamb") is directly present;
                        therefore, an intermediate structure for worship is unnecessary. A temple is a place set apart to
                        meet God; here the entire city is that place. The whole city is effectively one giant Holy of Holies (as
                        noted by its cube shape). In ancient times, no one could enter the Holy of Holies except the High
                        Priest once a year, and that with blood. Now all have access constantly, living in the Holy of Holies,
                        because Christ (the Lamb) has made the once-for-all sacrifice to allow us to draw near. So instead of
                        a sanctuary building, God and the Lamb Themselves constitute the sacred presence. Wherever you go
                        in the city, you are in the temple - meaning in immediate worshipful communion with God.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This fulfills what Jesus told the Samaritan woman: "the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain,
                    nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father... true worshipers will worship in spirit and truth" (John 4:21-23). Ultimately,
                    worship is not about a location because God's presence is everywhere with His people. Here, it's literally
                    true no temple, because worship is life and life is worship, in direct encounter with God. Also, it shows
                    the completion of God's plan from Eden: He originally dwelt with man without temple; temple came in after
                    sin as a gracious means to allow His presence among a sinful people. With sin gone, we return to that direct
                    fellowship but on an even higher level (no possibility of fall).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Brethren writer F.B. Hole noted a technicality: the Greek word for temple used in Revelation (naos) usually
                    means the inner sanctuary. Revelation never uses the term for an outer temple building, only naos (e.g. Rev
                    11:19, "the temple of God was opened in heaven" referring to God's immediate presence). So here saying
                    "no naos" indicates no inner sanctuary separate from people <sup>27</sup>. Because "the Lord God Almighty and the
                    Lamb are the naos." That is, God Himself is the meeting place. We worship in the very presence of His
                    person.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>No need of sun or moon: Now the lighting of the city is addressed. John doesn't say there is no sun
                        or moon in the new creation at all (though possibly not needed anywhere), but specifically the city
                        doesn't need them. Why? "For the glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its light." God's own
                        radiance provides all the illumination required. In the earthly night we depend on sun by day, moon
                        by night - but in New Jerusalem there is never night (v.25) and the effulgence of God makes any
                        other light source redundant. This fulfills Old Testament prophecy: "The sun shall no longer be your
                        light by day, nor for brightness shall the moon give light to you; But the LORD will be to you an everlasting
                        light, and your God your glory" (Isaiah 60:19) <sup>7</sup>. Indeed Isaiah 60:20 continues, "For the LORD will be
                        your everlasting light." Here we see that literally in the city. The Lamb (Christ) is specifically called its
                        lamp (some translations) or light. This reminds us of Jesus' claim, "I am the light of the world. He who
                        follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life" (John 8:12). In eternity, that metaphor
                        becomes concrete - Jesus' presence and glory illuminates everything.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The dual statement "glory of God illuminated it, and the Lamb is its light" again hints at Father and Son
                    together being the source. It shows the Lamb shares the glory of God (a testimony to Christ's divinity). No
                    lesser lights needed. Also, practically, it means no natural cycles of day-night control life in the city; life is
                    continuous and un-dimmed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some wonder: does this mean in the new heavens and earth there will be no sun at all? Possibly the new
                    creation operates differently. Or perhaps the sun/moon still exist for the outside earth but the city's
                    brightness eclipses them locally. However, given that "no night" is stated, it implies a kind of self-contained
                    brilliance everywhere. So likely no sun or moon in eternity, or at least not in any necessary capacity. God is
                    directly the light source. It's as if creation has been brought back to Genesis 1:3 "Let there be light" before
                    the sun was made; God's own light sufficed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Symbolic note: Light = truth and holiness. Darkness = sin/ignorance. That there is no need for created
                    lights because the Creator's glory shines means truth is fully revealed, and holiness permeates. We won't
                    need, for example, secondary "luminaries" (like prophets, Scripture, sacraments) to mediate truth to us - we
                    will directly bask in the light of God. Now we see by the light of the Word (Ps 119:105), then we see by God
                    Himself in person.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: No temple calls us even now to focus on God Himself in our worship, not external
                    forms or places. We gather in church buildings, but the real sanctuary is Christ's presence in our midst. We
                    can experience a foretaste of "no temple" when we truly commune with God anywhere, anytime by the
                    Spirit. Also, no need of sun or moon - God's presence is all-sufficient. Today, we often look to created things
                    (even good things like the beauty of nature or human wisdom) to give us light/joy. But in the end, God is
                    our light. So we should learn to live in His light now: seeking His guidance, His truth as our primary
                    illumination. Psalm 36:9 says, "In Your light we see light." The more we walk closely with Jesus, the more
                    clearly we see everything else.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, consider the comfort: no more darkness at all. Many people fear literal darkness or the metaphorical
                    darkness of evil, depression, ignorance. God promises an existence free of all those shadows. It's literally all
                    light, all the time - but unlike our sun which can burn or blind, God's light will be perfectly pleasant and life-
                    giving. 1 John 1:5, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all." We will live that reality eternally.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:24-26 - The Nations and Kings Bring Their Glory; Gates Always Open</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring
                    their glory and honour into it. And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.
                    And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into it." (21:24-26, KJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These verses describe how the rest of the earth (outside the city) relates to the New Jerusalem. It's a bit
                    mysterious because in the eternal state we typically think all redeemed are part of the city. But this scene,
                    especially read in a millennial context, shows an ongoing relationship between the city (the glorified saints)
                    and "nations" and "kings" outside.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The nations of those who are saved" (some translations: "the nations shall walk in its light"). This
                        indicates there are nations (peoples, ethnic groups) living on the new earth. These are distinct from
                        the glorified Church in the city. Many interpreters see this as evidence that 21:9-26 is speaking of the
                        Millennium: nations on earth are still in existence (like mortal populations). In the Millennium,
                        indeed, nations continue (Israel and Gentile nations), and Christ rules them with the help of His
                        glorified saints (who could be represented by the city). In eternity, arguably, all the redeemed
                        become one "nation" under God, though it's possible God maintains diversity of peoples for His
                        glory. The phrase "of them which are saved" clarifies these are righteous nations, not rebel ones (the
                        wicked have been cast out by now). So these "nations" are composed of those saved through the
                        ages (possibly tribulation survivors who entered the Millennium and had offspring, etc., eventually
                        translated into eternal state). They walk in the light of New Jerusalem, meaning they live by the
                        truth and blessings that emanate from the city. Isaiah 60:3 prophesied, "Nations shall come to your
                        light, and kings to the brightness of your rising." This is directly reflected here <sup>5</sup>. So, the city serves as
                        a lamp and center for human life across the earth.</li>
                    <li>"The kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it." During the Millennium, there will be
                        kings governing various nations under Christ. This says those kings will acknowledge the supremacy
                        of Christ and His city by bringing "their glory" (the best of their produce, wealth, homage) into New
                        Jerusalem. In ancient times, subject nations brought tribute to the capital of an empire. Here, it's
                        voluntary worship: they deposit the honor (perhaps cultural treasures, praise, etc.) before God. In
                        Isaiah 60:11, speaking of Zion's future glory: "Your gates shall be open continually... that men may bring
                        to you the wealth of the Gentiles, and their kings in procession." <sup>5</sup> Exactly echoed here the idea of
                        continuous open gates (v.25) and kings bringing wealth. In eternity (if this still applies), it might
                        mean that whatever splendid achievements or offerings the redeemed nations have, they attribute it
                        to God's glory, symbolically "bringing it into the city." All greatness is surrendered to the Greatest
                        One.</li>
                    <li>"Gates shall not be shut at all by day (and there is no night)." City gates in ancient times were
                        closed at night or in war to keep out enemies. Here, because there is no night (constant day under
                        God's light) and no threat (Satan and sin are gone), the gates are never shut. This signifies absolute
                        security and openness. There's free access to God at all times. It also implies the fellowship
                        between the city and the nations is unhindered - people can come and go in fellowship and worship
                        constantly. It is the ultimate safe society: nothing to fear, nothing to hide. For those in the
                        Millennium interpretation: The city (with gates open) could mean the glorified saints are always
                        accessible to and serving the nations, perhaps as governors or teachers (Isaiah 30:20-21 hints at
                        "teachers" guiding people in the kingdom, which some think are glorified believers). But in any case,
                        the open gates show generosity of God He is not shutting Himself away. Contrast in Revelation
                        22:15, the unclean are "outside" permanently. But those outside here are saved nations, so the open
                        gate means they have entry as welcome worshipers.</li>
                    <li>Reiteration (v.26): "They shall bring the glory and honor of the nations into it." The double mention
                        (with v.24) emphasizes how all glory ultimately ends up being God's. Whatever is honorable among
                        nations (cultural glory, wealth, splendor), it's laid at God's feet. We might imagine, for example, the
                        art, music, and achievements of various peoples, purified of sin, being offered in worship. God is
                        glorified by the rich tapestry of human (redeemed) culture. He is not just the God of one narrow
                        group; He's honored by every tribe, tongue, and nation (Rev 7:9). The kings/nations don't lose their
                        identity-rather they fully subordinate their glory to God's glory.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In the eternal perspective, this assures us that diversity is not erased but unified in praise. The multitude in
                    Revelation 7 wore different cultural markers (palm branches, etc.) but all praised God together. Here we see
                    the same principle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a doctrinal standpoint, verses 24-26 pose a puzzle if strictly eternal state: who are these kings and
                    nations if every saved person is presumably in the city? One solution: perhaps not everyone lives in the city
                    proper; maybe some saved (like non-Church) have dwellings outside but come into the city regularly.
                    Another: "nations" might simply mean all the peoples, emphasizing that the redeemed collectively still carry
                    a sense of their origins but now all act as one in worship. Either way, the main point is the universal scope
                    of God's kingdom and the continuous worship directed to God from all creation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: Think of the contrast to our world now. Today, nations seek their own glory, kings fight
                    each other, gates and borders are shut for security. In God's future, nations will cooperate to glorify God,
                    rulers will humbly submit, and doors will be open in trust and peace. We should live in light of that coming
                    reality by cultivating unity among believers of all backgrounds now, by honoring God with the "glory" of our
                    own life (our talents, achievements laid at His feet), and by keeping the "gates" of fellowship open (being
                    welcoming, not fearful). Also, the fact that the nations walk in the city's light reminds us that we, the Church,
                    even now are called to be light to the world (Phil 2:15). One day, indeed, the world will walk in the light
                    emanating from God's people perfected. That encourages us not to hide our light now but let it shine as a
                    foretaste of what's to come.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lastly, on security: "never shut gates" means total absence of danger. Many of us carry anxieties and take
                    measures to protect ourselves (lock doors, etc.). Imagine the relief and freedom of a world where no evil
                    can ever threaten. God promises that level of security. We can rest in His ultimate protection plan, and even
                    now trust that our lives are in His hands.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 21:27 - Nothing Impure Enters (Holiness of the City)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And there shall in no wise enter into it anything that defiles, neither whatsoever works abomination, or
                    makes a lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life." (21:27)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chapter closes with a strong affirmation of the city's holiness and the qualification for entry. After
                    describing its splendor, John reminds us that only the redeemed can partake in it.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"By no means" (in no wise) will anything unclean enter. This is an absolute negation. Nothing
                        that defiles (morally or ritually unclean), or anyone practicing abomination (detestable sins, often
                        idolatry or gross immorality) or falsehood ("makes a lie" - living in deception), will ever enter the New
                        Jerusalem. In other words, sin and sinners have no place there. This picks up from verse 8's list of
                        those consigned to the lake of fire. After the final judgment, the only ones left are the redeemed and
                        purified. So this is simultaneously a promise and a warning: a promise that heaven will be utterly
                        pure (no more of sin's pollution in our fellowship), and a warning that if someone clings to sin, they
                        will not be there.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This verse echoes passages like Isaiah 52:1, "O Jerusalem, the holy city: for the uncircumcised and the unclean
                    shall no longer come to you." Also earlier in Revelation, at the end of the next chapter (22:15) a similar
                    statement lists those "outside" as dogs, sorcerers, etc. It underscores that the separation between righteous
                    and wicked is final and complete. We will never again experience what we do now the tension of living
                    among sin or our own temptation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life." This is the sole criterion: one's name
                        in the Lamb's Book of Life (see also Rev 20:15). The "Book of Life" is essentially God's roster of the
                        saved - those who belong to Christ (the Lamb) who died for them. That our names must be written
                        there means salvation by grace, not works. We enter not because we never sinned (we did), but
                        because we've been cleansed by the Lamb's blood and our names recorded by His grace.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Thus, the city's population = the redeemed of all ages. If your name is in the Book of Life, you have full
                    rights to enter (like a citizen's name on a registry). If not, entry is impossible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's called the Lamb's Book of Life to stress Christ's redemptive role. He purchased our life by His death as the
                    Lamb of God. So again, Jesus is the key. It ties in that the only people in the city are those who came
                    through those pearl gates - i.e., through Christ's sacrifice (as we discussed about pearls). They have been
                    made pure by Him, so they no longer defile; they have been forgiven of lies and abominations, and given a
                    new nature that doesn't practice such things.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This verse is a fitting capstone to Chapter 21: after all the lovely description, it soberly reminds the reader -
                    make sure you are among those written in the Lamb's Book! It invites us implicitly: Is my name in that Book? If I
                    trust in Christ, it is - and thus my hope is secure. If not, I must turn to Him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Personal Application: This truth should cultivate in us a longing for holiness now. If nothing impure will be
                    in our eternal home, we should aim to avoid defilement here as much as possible. Of course, we still sin,
                    but our attitude should be to pursue purity. "Everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is
                    pure" (1 John 3:3). We want to dress rehears for heaven by living in truth and holiness, shunning the
                    "abominations" of the world's corruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also gives comfort that heaven will have no painful memories of sin coming back to haunt, no danger of it
                    ever being spoiled. All the heartbreak caused by lies, immorality, and abominations in this life - none of that
                    enters God's city. We will be completely safe morally; even our own hearts will no longer desire anything
                    impure. Imagine that freedom never an impure thought or motive again! Truly, what a holy and happy
                    environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, evangelistically, this verse challenges us: there are people we know whose names are not yet in the
                    Book of Life. While the gates stand open now (the gospel invitation is open), someday the only ones inside
                    will be those written. So we should fervently pray and witness for people to come to the Lamb. It's
                    ultimately the Lamb's book meaning we point people to the Lamb, Jesus, for salvation. He is willing to
                    inscribe any name when a person repents and believes. Our citizenship is in heaven (Phil 3:20), so let's
                    also be ambassadors calling others to become citizens through the gospel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, Revelation 21 has shown us the radiant future awaiting believers: a new creation free from
                    curse, a capital city where God dwells with His people, every aspect filled with His glory and perfection. It is
                    both a theological vision (God's purposes fulfilled, promises kept) and a personal hope (every tear wiped,
                    each of us enjoying intimate fellowship with our Savior). For a personal bible study, the applications are rich:
                    we are encouraged to endure suffering with the hope of glory, to seek holiness in light of our pure destiny,
                    to value fellowship and unity as we will in that city, and above all to treasure Christ - the Lamb - who is the
                    light, the temple, the foundation, and the entry of that entire blessed realm.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As the next chapter will invite, "The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come!"" (Rev 22:17). We, the prospective bride,
                    already echo: "Even so, come, Lord Jesus!" For only in His coming will Revelation 21 become reality.
                    Meanwhile, we hold fast to these "true and faithful words"<sup>4</sup>, letting the vision of New Jerusalem shape
                    our lives here and now. Amen
                    may we live as citizens of that heavenly city, eagerly awaiting its
                    coming!
                </p>
