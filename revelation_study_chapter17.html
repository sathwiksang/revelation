                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    Revelation 17 gives a detailed "behind the scenes" look at the judgment of "Babylon the
                    Great," depicted as a great harlot riding a beast. Notably, this chapter is a parenthetical vision - it "does
                    not pursue the chronological course" of Revelation's narrative but zooms in to explain why Babylon is
                    judged so severely. The focus here is on the religious corruption of Babylon in partnership with worldly
                    powers. In Scripture, man's sin often takes two broad forms: (1) corruption symbolized by a harlot
                    indulging in idolatry and immorality, and (2) violence - symbolized by a beast representing arrogant, brute
                    force <sup>2</sup>. Chapter 17 addresses the first (corrupt false religion), while the beast she rides embodies the
                    second (violent political power). We will study verse by verse, drawing on insights from Plymouth Brethren
                    authors (like John N. Darby and William Kelly) and similar dispensational theologians, and noting parallel
                    Scriptures. This is both a doctrinal examination and a personal Bible study - thus we will consider not only
                    prophetic details but also spiritual lessons and applications for today.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 1 - The Angel's Invitation to Witness Judgment</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And one of the seven angels which had the seven bowls came and talked with me, saying to me, 'Come, I
                    will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters."</span> John is approached by one of the
                    bowl-judgment angels (from Revelation 16) and invited to see a specific vision of judgment. The subject is a
                    symbolic woman described as "the great harlot" (or "great prostitute") enthroned on "many waters." In
                    prophetic imagery, a harlot represents religious unfaithfulness ‚Äì a once-pure entity that has committed
                    spiritual adultery by allying with ungodly powers. The phrase "sits on many waters" indicates her
                    widespread influence over peoples and nations. Indeed, verse 15 will later explain that "the waters... where
                    the harlot sits" represent peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages <sup>3</sup>. In other words, this false
                    religious system has a global reach, dominating multitudes. The angel specifically calls this vision the
                    "judgment" of the harlot, meaning God is about to reveal why and how He will punish this corrupt system.
                    This sets the stage for understanding the gravity of her sins and the certainty of her fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The fact that this vision is introduced by a bowl-angel and termed a "judgment"
                    shows that the fall of Babylon is part of God's end-times wrath. It is a "retrogressive"
                    description (a flashback) explaining Babylon's offense against God <sup>1</sup>. The true Church is
                    often pictured in Scripture as a faithful bride to Christ, but this woman is a counterfeit
                    church - unfaithful, apostate, and flirting with the world's powers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: God invites John (and us as readers) to "come... and see" the fate of this harlot.
                    This is a call to discernment. We are warned that religious institutions can become corrupt
                    and face judgment. Believers today should not be awed by mere external success or power in
                    "Babylon-like" religious systems, but should view them through God's eyes. As we proceed, we
                    should ask: Am I aligned with the humble, faithful Bride of Christ, or with the worldly
                    spirit of Babylon?
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 2 - The Harlot's Fornication with Kings and Peoples</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"With whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and the inhabitants of the earth were made
                    drunk with the wine of her fornication."</span> Here the angel summarizes the crimes of the harlot. In symbolic
                    terms, fornication means unholy alliance or intimacy. The "kings of the earth" (political rulers) have
                    committed spiritual adultery with this woman ‚Äì in other words, church and state are in a corrupt
                    partnership for power. Historically, this evokes how medieval religious authorities sought the favor of
                    kings, and kings in turn used religion to legitimize their rule. Plymouth Brethren commentator J. N. Darby
                    notes that this harlot is "the great active idolatress" who seduced nations; "kings... have lived in guilty intimacy
                    with her," seeking her favors <sup>4</sup>. In addition, "the inhabitants of the earth" ‚Äì the masses of people - have
                    become spiritually intoxicated by her influence. They are "drunk with [her] wine," meaning they have
                    swallowed her idolatrous teachings and dazzling ritualism without discernment, to the point of spiritual
                    madness. This imagery deliberately echoes Jeremiah 51:7, which described ancient Babylon as a "golden
                    cup" in God's hand that "made all the earth drunk", with nations drinking her wine to their own madness
                    <sup>5</sup>. In the same way, this end-times Babylon has intoxicated the world with her false religion and worldly
                    seductions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notably, William Kelly points out the allure of this corrupted "Christian" system: "Everything that could
                    attract the natural man was there" - splendid ceremonies, wealth, power ‚Äì "but it is nothing but ecclesiastical
                    pride and corruption... a religion of grace and truth unknown". He specifically identifies practices like
                    selling indulgences for sin, promoting false dogmas (e.g. transubstantiation, papal infallibility),
                    venerating relics, and blasphemous idol-worship of saints, angels, and the Virgin Mary <sup>7</sup>. These
                    striking details show how closely the prophecy corresponds to the history of the apostate church centered
                    in Rome. Indeed, Darby remarks that this "character [is] plain enough to mark the Roman or Papal
                    system". The harlot's illicit unions with kings remind us of how, for centuries, the Roman Church
                    engaged in political intrigues and alliances (spiritual "fornication") to gain worldly influence. Her making the
                    world drunk hints at the deceptive appeal of her idolatries ‚Äì a heady mix of truth and lies that ensnares
                    hearts and minds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: Spiritual infidelity is a grave sin. Just as ancient Israel was condemned for "playing
                    the harlot" with pagan nations and gods (e.g. Ezekiel 16, Hosea 2), so this end-time religious
                    system is judged for compromising with secular powers and spreading false worship. The
                    imagery of fornication indicates that what should belong to God alone (devotion, trust,
                    worship) has been given to others. The result is corruption at the highest levels (kings) and
                    mass deception among the people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We must guard against any compromise of our faith for political or material
                    gain. The "wine" of Babylon can be enticing - it may promise unity, prosperity, or influence
                    ‚Äì but it leads to spiritual drunkenness (loss of discernment and moral clarity). Believers are
                    called to spiritual sobriety, not to be intoxicated by the world (1 Thessalonians 5:6-8). Ask: Are
                    we flirting with the world's values or remaining faithful to Christ? The fate of Babylon
                    warns that seeking friendship with the world is enmity with God (James 4:4).

                <h2>Verse 3 - The Vision: A Woman on a Scarlet Beast in the Wilderness</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"So he carried me away in the Spirit into the wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored
                    beast which was full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns."</span> Now John is transported
                    "in the Spirit" to a wilderness, a desert-like setting, to see the vision. The wilderness suggests a place of
                    spiritual desolation ‚Äì this harlot does not dwell in the fruitful garden of God's presence, but in a dry,
                    barren realm (implying that, despite her outward riches, she is spiritually bankrupt) <sup>9</sup>. Some interpreters
                    even see a hint of the literal ruined "wilderness" of the Campagna outside Rome's walls <sup>10</sup>, but the
                    emphasis is likely on the spiritual wasteland that Babylon inhabits (contrast this with the woman of
                    Revelation 12 who fled to the wilderness under God's protection - here the wilderness is the abode of the
                    harlot by God's perspective, indicating her lifelessness toward Him).
                </p>
                <p>
                    John sees "a woman sitting on a scarlet beast." This immediately connects to earlier prophecies. The
                    beast with seven heads and ten horns is a familiar figure - it was first seen in Revelation 13 as the monster
                    rising from the sea, and it echoes the fourth beast of Daniel's prophecy (Daniel 7:7 with ten horns). The
                    angel later confirms this beast represents an empire with seven heads (rulers) and ten horns (kings).
                    William Kelly calls it "the well-known emblem of the Roman empire" <sup>11</sup>. In John's day, the Roman Empire was
                    the world power, and prophecy indicates this empire (or its successor) will have a final form in the end
                    times. The beast's scarlet color may signify luxury, royalty, or bloodlust. The beast is also "full of names of
                    blasphemy," meaning it openly defies God, claiming honors or titles belonging to God alone. This recalls
                    how Roman emperors assumed divine titles and in the future, the beast's leader (the Antichrist figure) will
                    blaspheme God blatantly (Rev. 13:5-6). The seven heads and ten horns show it is the same beastly power
                    as in Rev 13, now carrying the woman.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The woman riding the beast indicates a close relationship: she is supported by the beast, and she steers
                    or influences it for a time. This portrays a church-state union. Historically, after the Roman Empire
                    "Christianized," a powerful church rode upon the secular empire's legacy. Darby explains that this scene
                    shows "a woman, a religious system, sitting on an imperial beast... having the form which marked it Roman." The
                    woman is "gorgeously and imperially arrayed" and holds a cup of idolatries, showing this is a religious
                    system entwined with imperial power <sup>12</sup>. For a period, the political beast carries the religious system ‚Äì
                    indicating that the empire (and its client kings) give authority and prestige to the false church. The
                    wilderness setting may imply that, from God's viewpoint, this alliance occurs outside His true spiritual realm
                    - it is a perversion of His design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The beast represents godless political power (specifically the Roman Empire in
                    prophecy). The woman represents apostate religion. Their coupling reveals a key truth: false
                    religion often rides on the back of secular power. For a time, a corrupt church can wield
                    great influence over empires (as seen historically in the Holy Roman Empire and various
                    theocracies). But this is an unstable, temporary alliance. The description here already hints at
                    tension ‚Äì the woman sits atop a blasphemous beast, showing the union of convenience
                    between religious apostasy and political arrogance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We learn the danger of a church that seeks political power. When Christianity
                    prostitutes itself for influence, it may gain earthly splendor but becomes a "wilderness"
                    spiritually. Believers should be wary of any movement that prioritizes political clout over
                    faithfulness to Christ. Also, observe God's perspective: what the world sees as a grand
                    partnership (a woman on a regal beast), God sees as a harlot in a wasteland riding a scarlet
                    monstrosity. We need spiritual vision to discern things as God does, not as they appear
                    superficially.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 4 - The Harlot's Opulence and Idolatry</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stones and pearls,
                    having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the filthiness of her fornication."</span> The attire and
                    accessories of the harlot convey her character. Purple and scarlet were the colors of royalty, luxury, and
                    pomp in the ancient world. She is "arrayed" (clothed) in these, signifying that she presents herself as a
                    queenly, wealthy power. Strikingly, William Kelly notes that "her officials alone in Christendom array
                    themselves in these colors of the world's glory" <sup>13</sup> ‚Äì an unmistakable reference to the purple and scarlet
                    vestments of Roman Catholic cardinals and bishops. The woman is also lavishly decked with gold, precious
                    stones, and pearls - symbols of immense wealth. This calls to mind the historic riches of ecclesiastical Rome
                    (golden altars, jeweled chalices, etc.). Every outward indication is one of splendor, wealth, and grandeur.
                    In her hand is a golden cup, a vessel of great beauty and value - yet it is filled with "abominations" and the
                    impurities of her fornication. In Scripture, "abominations" often refers to idols or idolatrous practices
                    <sup>14</sup>. Darby flatly states: "Abominations are simply idols; the filthiness of her fornication" refers to the immoral
                    and corrupting aspects that accompany that idolatry <sup>14</sup>. So this golden cup, though outwardly impressive,
                    is full of the spiritual poison of idol worship and perverse rites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This detail strongly parallels Jeremiah 51:7, as mentioned earlier: "Babylon has been a golden cup in the
                    Lord's hand that "made all the earth drunk" <sup>5</sup>. Here, Babylon the Great holds her own golden cup to
                    intoxicate the nations with idolatrous abominations. Kelly remarks: "Idolatry is the awful stamp that she
                    bears" both in what she offers to men and in what God sees written on her <sup>15</sup>. Despite all her gold and
                    jewels, her true contents are "unclean things" ‚Äì false doctrines, idolatrous masses, saint-and-Mary
                    veneration, etc., which God calls abominations. The contrast is stark: outward magnificence, inward
                    monstrosity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The harlot's opulence also contrasts with the true Church. In this present age, the faithful Church ("the
                    bride") is often despised, a pilgrim people with no worldly glory ‚Äì her glory is heavenly and moral. By
                    contrast, "Babylon" claims earthly glory now: "Everything that looks fairest, she thinks, ought to be devoted to
                    religion", Kelly observes, yet it is a religion "of pride and corruption", not of Christ. Indeed, he notes
                    how this harlot system loves money (selling spiritual favors), power, and external show, but lacks true
                    humility and holiness <sup>7</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: Great wealth and splendor in a religious system are not proofs of God's approval; in
                    fact, they can mask great corruption. The golden cup full of abominations teaches that
                    false religion often disguises its spiritual poison in a glittering chalice. This image should
                    also remind us of the "golden cup" of the Lord's true fellowship (1 Corinthians 10:16) versus
                    the "cup of demons" (1 Corinthians 10:21). Babylon's religion is a demonic counterfeit of true
                    worship - a bejeweled cup of idolatry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Appearances are deceiving. The harlot is richly dressed, but God sees the "filth"
                    in her cup. We must not judge ministries or churches by outward prosperity, ornate
                    cathedrals, or elaborate ritual alone. The real question is: What's in the cup? Is it the pure
                    gospel of Christ or a mix of truth with idolatry? Believers should value truth and holiness
                    over external trappings. Also, personal application: we ourselves are called "vessels" (2
                    Timothy 2:21). Do we present a golden exterior of religiosity while harboring inner
                    abominations? God desires "truth in the inward parts" (Psalm 51:6).
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 5 - "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, MOTHER OF HARLOTS"</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS
                    AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."</span> In John's vision, the harlot's forehead is emblazoned with a
                    startling title. In ancient Rome, prostitutes were said to wear headbands with their names; here God makes
                    sure the identity of this woman is clear to those with spiritual insight. The title begins with "MYSTERY",
                    indicating that there is a secret or hidden meaning to this woman. This is not literal Babylon of old (which
                    had long fallen in John's time) but a "mystery" Babylon ‚Äì a symbol. In biblical terms, a "mystery" is a
                    sacred secret now revealed by God <sup>16</sup>. William Kelly explains that "a 'mystery' points to something
                    undiscoverable by the natural mind... a secret which, when revealed by God, becomes plain" <sup>16</sup>. So, Mystery
                    Babylon is spiritual Babylon ‚Äì the hidden dimension of Babylon-like evil working through a religious
                    system. Paul mentioned the "mystery of lawlessness" (2 Thessalonians 2:7) already at work in his day - the
                    seeds of apostasy that would one day bloom fully in this Babylon.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, she is called "Babylon the Great." This links her to ancient Babylon in character. Just as literal
                    Babylon was the fountainhead of idolatry and defiance against God (the Tower of Babel, Genesis 11, and
                    the idolatrous empire of Nebuchadnezzar), so this end-time entity carries that legacy. H.A. Ironside, a
                    dispensational author, wrote that "Babylon became the fountainhead of idolatry and the mother of every
                    heathen and pagan system in the world. The mystery-religion originated there spread in various forms throughout
                    the whole earth and is still with us today", having infiltrated even Christendom <sup>17</sup>. In this sense, Babylon the
                    Great represents the sum-total of all false religion ultimately embodied in this apostate pseudo-
                    Christianity centered in Rome. She is the "MOTHER OF HARLOTS", meaning she gives birth to other false
                    religions and cults. All spiritual prostitutions - whether pagan idolatries or perversions of true faith - find
                    their prototype in Babylon. For example, the mother-and-child cult of ancient Babel (Semiramis and
                    Tammuz) spread to many cultures (Isis & Horus in Egypt, Ishtar & Tammuz in Mesopotamia, etc.) and some
                    of its concepts (a Queen of Heaven with an miraculously conceived son, mourning for a dead god, etc.) were
                    later absorbed into Roman Catholic Marian devotion and rites <sup>18 19</sup>. Truly, the harlot is "mother" to
                    countless harlot daughters - all the systems that depart from pure devotion to God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She is also mother of "the abominations of the earth" - i.e., the idols and blasphemies that pollute the
                    world. Kelly emphasizes that this refers to open idolatries: "Babylon is the parent of the prostitutes and of the
                    abominations (idolatries) of the earth", not merely subtle errors but "open image worship" - the veneration of
                    creatures, images, relics instead of the Creator <sup>20</sup>. He specifically alludes to the "horrors of Mariolatry",
                    the worship of angels and saints, relics, and so on <sup>21</sup>. This is remarkably direct: the prophecy is pointing to
                    a religious system claiming Christian names and titles ("mystery" implies a pseudo-Christian form), yet
                    engaging in gross idolatry as pagan as any other. History bears this out: by the Middle Ages, the Roman
                    church had imported multitudes of Babylonish practices (prayers for the dead, incense, images, the title
                    "Pontifex Maximus" for its leader, etc.).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The inclusion of the word "MYSTERY" in the title suggests that this false church presents itself as part of the
                    "mysteries" of God, yet it is in reality the "mystery of iniquity." There is an aura of deep spiritual secret about her
                    - think of the esoteric rituals, the mystique of ancient tradition - but it's a corrupted mystery. Some scholars
                    also connect this Mystery Babylon to the vision in Zechariah 5:5-11, where a woman personifying
                    Wickedness is sealed in a basket and transported to Shinar (Babylonia) to have a house built for her in the
                    end times. This suggests that the wickedness of false religion was being kept for a future Babylon - exactly
                    what we see in Revelation 17.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: This verse essentially names the system: it is Babylon, in mystery form. The
                    reference to Babylon tells us we are dealing with the same spirit that animated ancient Babel ‚Äì
                    pride, idolatry, confusion ‚Äì now clothed in a Christian-like mystery. Many Protestant
                    expositors since the Reformation have identified this "Babylon" with the Roman Catholic
                    Church. Plymouth Brethren writers agree that Rome (ecclesiastical Babylon) is primarily in
                    view <sup>22</sup>. However, they also caution that this prophecy looks beyond just the medieval
                    papacy to a future climax. Kelly notes that while the "Protestant application" (to Romanism)
                    has much truth, the full "result will not be till the end of the age", when all strands of false
                    religion unite in one grand Babylonian system <sup>23 24</sup>. In the end, apostate Roman
                    Christianity may well absorb or lead a coalition of global false spirituality - truly becoming
                    the mother of all harlotries on earth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We must examine our own worship and doctrine in light of God's Word. Is it
                    pure, or mixed with "Babylonian" tradition? The label "Mother of Harlots" warns us that false
                    religion reproduces itself - error begets more error. We should trace teachings and practices
                    back to their source: are they rooted in Scripture or in ancient human traditions? Also, this
                    verse challenges us: Where is our spiritual motherhood? The true Church is "Jerusalem
                    above, the mother of us all" (Galatians 4:26), but false systems look to Babylon as their
                    mother. Every believer must ensure that their faith lineage comes from apostolic truth (New
                    Jerusalem) and not from the apostate church (Babylon). Finally, note that the name is on her
                    forehead - visible to all with discernment. If we walk closely with the Lord and know Scripture,
                    we will not be fooled by Mystery Babylon; her forehead name will be clear to us.

                <h2>Verse 6 - Drunk with the Blood of Saints</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.
                    And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement."</span> Beyond her idolatries, Babylon is charged with
                    violence against God's people. The woman is pictured as intoxicated with blood - having gorged herself
                    on the persecution and murder of the saints (God's holy people). The phrase "blood of the saints"
                    suggests victims generally, and "blood of the martyrs (witnesses) of Jesus" emphasizes those who were
                    killed specifically for their testimony of Christ. Astonishingly, this false "Christian" religious system has killed
                    the true followers of Christ. Darby observes that "All the blood of the saints was found in her: she was the
                    persecuting murderess of those God delighted in, who bore witness to Jesus." No wonder John "marveled" greatly
                    - "the prophet was astonished, for it was what the church had come to" <sup>25</sup>! This vision reveals a horrific truth: a
                    counterfeit church, styling itself as the true one, has become the chief enemy of God's real saints. John
                    had known pagan Rome's persecutions, but to see a professedly Christian system drunken on killing
                    Christians was deeply shocking. William Kelly explains John's reaction: he "marveled greatly that
                    Christendom, under the guise of the holy church, should become the bitterest of persecutors, more murderous
                    against the witnesses of Jesus than even paganism had been" <sup>26</sup>. Indeed, history confirms that during the
                    Middle Ages and Inquisition, more Bible-believing Christians were slaughtered by the papal persecutors
                    than in the early Roman pagan persecutions. The harlot has much to account for: from crusades against
                    "heretics," to inquisitions, burnings, and massacres (e.g. the Albigenses, Waldenses, Huguenots, etc.), the
                    blood of martyrs drenched the soil of Europe. Revelation 18:24 later says, "in her was found the blood of
                    prophets and saints, and of all who were slain on the earth." This indicates she inherits not only the guilt of
                    papal Rome, but of all Jerusalem and Babylon before her (Matthew 23:35 all righteous blood on earth will
                    be required of the apostate Jerusalem leadership; similarly Babylon embodies collective guilt of centuries of
                    martyrdom).
                </p>
                <p>
                    John "marveled with great amazement" at this sight. The Greek implies a bewildered, horrified
                    astonishment. It was inconceivable that something claiming to be of God could be so bloodthirsty. But
                    such is the nature of false, apostate religion: it cannot tolerate the true gospel and those who hold it. Darby
                    comments that formal religion that has lost truth "always becomes the instigator of persecution" - e.g.,
                    the Jewish leaders against Christ and the apostles, and later Rome against true believers <sup>27</sup> (see the
                    footnote in Darby's commentary). False church often uses the power of the state (the beast) to do its
                    killing, but God lays the blame at the harlot's feet - she is drunk with the blood.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The persecuting nature of the harlot reveals her as the anti-church (just as the
                    beast is an anti-Christ empire). In Revelation, we have a counterfeit trinity: the Dragon
                    (Satan), the Beast (Antichrist empire/leader), and the False Prophet (Antichrist religious
                    figure). The harlot Babylon can be seen as the false bride, parodying the true Bride of Christ.
                    Instead of loving the saints, she kills them. This verse starkly identifies Babylon with Rome,
                    because it was Rome - first pagan, then papal - that was notorious for shedding the blood of
                    Christian martyrs. No other city or system so perfectly fits being "drunk" on the blood of Jesus'
                    witnesses. As one Protestant historian phrased it, the papal system "has shed more Christian
                    blood than any other institution that ever existed." <sup>28</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We should not be surprised that genuine disciples of Christ face persecution,
                    sometimes even from those claiming to be "Christians." Jesus warned of a coming time when
                    "whoever kills you will think he offers God service" (John 16:2). The history of Babylon the Great
                    reminds us that empty religion hates living faith. True believers must sometimes dissent
                    from corrupt church authorities, and this can be costly. Yet the blood of the martyrs is
                    precious to God (Revelation 6:9-11). If we face opposition or ostracism for holding to biblical
                    truth (even from within broader Christendom), we stand in a long line of witnesses. John
                    marveled; perhaps we should too at the mystery of iniquity that can so twist religion into
                    murder. But we should also be prepared: if organized religion departs from God, it will
                    persecute those who remain faithful. Let this verse search our own hearts: Do we harbor
                    enmity toward true brethren? The spirit of Babylon is one of pride and intolerance, utterly
                    contrary to the love of Christ.

                <h2>Verse 7 - Angelic Explanation Begins: The Mystery of Woman and
                    Beast</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"But the angel said to me, 'Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the
                    beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns."</span> John is transfixed with
                    astonishment, but the angel gently rebukes him ‚Äì "Why do you marvel?" - and promises to explain the
                    mystery. This is encouraging: God does not leave us in bafflement at these symbols; Scripture interprets
                    Scripture. The phrase "mystery of the woman and of the beast" indicates that both the harlot and the
                    beast carry hidden meanings that need divine illumination. We are about to get Heaven's interpretation of
                    the major symbols: the woman (harlot), the beast she rides, the seven heads, and the ten horns. Notice the
                    wording: "the beast that carries her." This reiterates that the woman's power depends on the beast's support.
                    At this point in the vision, the harlot is still riding high, carried by the empire and its client kings. The
                    angel will explain how this relationship plays out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the reader, verse 7 is a turning point: from descriptive vision to interpretive prophecy. We are reminded
                    that spiritual truths require spiritual revelation. John could not discern the full meaning of what he saw
                    until the angel explained. Likewise, in studying prophecy, we must rely on Scripture and the Holy Spirit, not
                    our own wisdom. Darby notes that if John had penetrated the mystery already, he would not have marveled;
                    hence the angel's question and forthcoming explanation <sup>28</sup>. This verse also shows God's compassion: He
                    sees John's confusion and offers clarity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: God himself provides the interpretation of key symbols here, so we should pay
                    close attention to verses 8-18. There is no need for wild speculation when the angel literally
                    "tells us the mystery." The harlot and beast are not merely abstract ideas; they correspond to
                    real entities (a city/church and an empire) as the angel will show.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: When confronted with perplexing spiritual truths (things that make us "marvel"),
                    we should turn to God's Word for explanation. As the angel guided John, the Holy Spirit
                    guides us into truth (John 16:13). Also, the angel's question "Why did you marvel?" gently
                    suggests that if John fully knew God's character and the prophetic scriptures, he might not
                    have been so surprised ‚Äì after all, Scripture had long warned of a corrupt "woman" (false
                    religion) and fierce beasts (empires). For us, this is a nudge: we should not be na√Øve about the
                    state of Christendom or the world. God has already unveiled these mysteries so that,
                    informed by prophecy, we won't be dumbfounded when we see apostasy and persecution.
                    Instead, we'll say, "Yes, the Lord told us this would happen." As Amos 3:7 says, "Surely the Lord
                    God does nothing, unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets." He has revealed it -
                    our task is to understand and heed it.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 8 - The Beast: "Was, and Is Not, and Will Ascend" (Revival of
                    the Roman Empire)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"The beast that you saw was, and is not, and will ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to perdition.
                    And those who dwell on the earth will marvel, whose names are not written in the Book of Life from the
                    foundation of the world, when they see the beast that was, and is not, and yet is."</span> Now the angel begins
                    by explaining the beast. This verse is dense with information about the beast's career:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Was" - the beast once existed in some form.</li>
                    <li>"Is not" - at the time of the vision, it currently does not exist.</li>
                    <li>"Will ascend out of the bottomless pit" - it will return to existence by a demonic/satanic power
                        ("the abyss" is the realm of demonic spirits).</li>
                    <li>"And go to perdition" - its ultimate fate is destruction (perdition means ruin; the beast will be
                        utterly defeated by God).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Clearly, this is describing something unusual: an empire or power that existed, then ceased to exist ("died"),
                    and will later rise again in a latter-day incarnation empowered by hell, only to be finally destroyed. Futurist
                    interpreters (including Plymouth Brethren) have long identified this as the Roman Empire. In John's day, the
                    Roman Empire "was" (it existed). Later, it essentially "is not" ‚Äì the unified empire collapsed (traditionally
                    dated to AD 476 in the West). Yet prophecy says it will "ascend from the abyss" - meaning a future revival of
                    the Roman Empire in an anti-God form. John Darby writes: "The renewed Roman Empire, which had
                    disappeared, is blasphemous and diabolical in nature, and in this character goes to destruction" <sup>29</sup>. William
                    Kelly likewise notes that no past empire fits fully - we must look to a "still more complete development
                    before the Lamb judges the Beast" <sup>30</sup>. He and Darby both stress that pagan Rome did not "ascend from
                    the abyss" ‚Äì it was a normal historical power ordained by God in its time. But the coming revival will be
                    something uncanny, energized directly by Satan <sup>31</sup>. Indeed, Revelation 13:3 prophesied that one of the
                    beast's heads would seem to have a fatal wound but would be healed, and the whole world would marvel -
                    pointing to a resurrection of the empire. Here in verse 8, we see the world's reaction: earth-dwellers
                    (unbelievers) will marvel when the beast reappears. They will be in awe of the resurgence of this power,
                    which defies historical precedent. Kelly comments on how astonished people will be: an empire coming
                    back to life is "altogether exceptional in world history," like a resurrection - but in this case a satanic one <sup>32</sup>.
                    He notes that normally kingdoms rise and fall once; "as man does not believe in the resurrection of a man, he
                    does not look for the resurrection of an empire" - yet it will happen, and the devil will be its author <sup>33</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The verse also emphasizes that only those not written in the Book of Life (i.e. unbelievers) will marvel at the
                    beast. True believers, understanding prophecy, will not be deceived by the beast's return. But the unsaved
                    world will be mesmerized by the reborn Roman Empire and its leader. They will say, "Who is like the Beast?
                    Who can make war with him?" (Rev 13:4). This resurgence likely refers to a future confederation of nations
                    (the ten horns) forming a new Roman-like superpower, perhaps centered in Europe or around the
                    Mediterranean, headed by the Antichrist figure. Its ascent "from the bottomless pit" implies the dragon
                    (Satan) gives it power and authority (cf. Rev 13:2). In the end, however, this beast will "go to perdition" ‚Äì
                    meaning Christ will destroy it (as described in Revelation 19:19-20, the beast is captured and thrown alive
                    into the lake of fire).
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is sobering that this verse almost parodies the description of Christ ("who was, and is, and is to come"
                    Rev 1:4). The beast "was, is not, and will be present (yet is)." The Antichrist empire mimics Christ's death and
                    resurrection in a political realm. No wonder the lost world, without discernment, will marvel as if at a
                    miracle. But believers know its true origin - the abyss and its end - destruction.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: This verse strongly supports a futurist, premillennial understanding of
                    Revelation. It predicts a future revival of the Roman Empire shortly before Christ's return.
                    The "beast" is both the empire and its final emperor (the terms often interchange). The fact
                    that it "was and is not" in John's time means this prophecy could not have been completely
                    fulfilled in the first century (preterist view) nor fully through the papacy alone (historicist
                    view), because those interpretations struggle with the idea of the empire's revival. The
                    Brethren view is clear: the Roman Empire will re-emerge in a new form after a long absence
                    <sup>34 35</sup>. The source of its power will be Satan (the abyss), not God's ordinance (unlike past
                    secular governments, which Romans 13 says are appointed by God for order - this final phase
                    will be utterly lawless <sup>31</sup>). And its destiny is perdition - meaning it will be directly destroyed
                    by Christ (the Lamb) when He comes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We learn that history is under God's control, even the mysterious revivals of
                    empires. God foretold this "resurrection" of Rome long ago, showing His sovereignty over
                    what may appear a geopolitical marvel. For us personally, it's a caution not to marvel with
                    the world at worldly power. The unbelieving world is impressed by political and military
                    might - by whatever seems invincible ("who can war with the beast?"). But believers are told
                    the end from the beginning. When we see nations aligning in unprecedented ways or
                    perhaps the formation of a powerful federation (some see the European Union or a future
                    iteration as a precursor), we should remember this verse. Instead of gaping in awe or fearing,
                    we can say: "My Lord told me this - the beast will arise, but he's doomed." Our names in the Book
                    of Life should keep us from being star-struck by Satan's political miracles. Also, reflect
                    spiritually: are we drawn to worship "what was and is not and yet comes" (the latest worldly
                    trends, revivals of old ideas) rather than "Him who was, and is, and is to come" (the eternal
                    Christ)? Let's not be enamored with the Beast's spectacle, but stay faithful to the Lamb.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 9 - Seven Heads = Seven Mountains (and More)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman
                    sits."</span> The angel now moves to interpret the seven heads of the beast. He prefaces it with "here is the mind
                    which has wisdom," signaling that this detail requires spiritual discernment. The first layer of meaning: the
                    seven heads represent seven mountains. To the original readers, this would have been an immediate
                    clue: The city famously built on seven hills/mountains is ROME. In fact, one of Rome's ancient nicknames
                    is "the city on seven hills." By saying the woman sits on seven mountains, the angel identifies the
                    geographical locale of this prophecy - Rome - because verse 18 will confirm the woman is a great city
                    ruling over kings (and in John's time, only Rome fit that description). William Kelly stresses that we are not
                    free to ignore this feature: Scripture clearly wants us to make the Rome connection <sup>36</sup>. He writes, "It is
                    written to be believed, not to be explained away." <sup>37</sup>. Thus, Babylon the Great = Rome in some form. Not
                    literal Babylon in Mesopotamia (that would be one "mountain" on a plain, not seven), and not Jerusalem
                    (also not seven hills, and Jerusalem never ruled over the earth's kings in John's day). The wisdom required is
                    to see that "Babylon" is a code name for Rome's religious system ‚Äì something obvious to believers but
                    perhaps veiled from hostile authorities in John's time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many Protestant expositors (and the Brethren) saw in this an undeniable reference to the Roman Catholic
                    Church, centered in Rome. The woman sitting on Rome's seven hills signifies the Church headquartered
                    there. Indeed, "Rome, city and system, figures in the scene", writes Kelly <sup>38</sup>. Darby also affirms: "Rome is
                    more distinctly marked. It is the city of the seven hills." <sup>39</sup>. This identifying marker has been highlighted for
                    centuries: for example, the Reformers would point out that the papal tiara is even called "septimontium"
                    (seven mounts). Clearly, God did not want this "mystery" to be an impenetrable puzzle - He gave a big hint
                    by invoking Rome's topography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, the angel's interpretation of the heads doesn't stop at mountains. In the same breath (continuing
                    into verse 10), he says "and they are seven kings" or kingdoms. This shows a double meaning: the seven
                    heads symbolize both seven hills and seven kings/kingdoms. This dual symbolism is not uncommon in
                    prophecy (e.g., in Daniel, horns are kings and also kingdoms). So, the angel signals that we must think of
                    the heads as Rome's seven hills (geographical, pointing to the city) and as seven successive powers
                    (historical/political). The phrase "here is the mind which has wisdom" may imply that understanding the
                    dual reference requires spiritual insight. Simply put: the harlot sits on seven hills = she is Rome; the beast
                    has seven kings = there's a sequence of ruling powers involved, which verse 10 will elaborate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The identification of Babylon with Rome is one of the most important keys to
                    interpreting Revelation 17. God did not choose a random number of mountains ‚Äì He
                    specifically chose "seven mountains" to direct us to Rome. Thus, any interpretation that
                    ignores Rome is deficient. The Plymouth Brethren perspective fully acknowledges this: Babylon
                    is Roman ecclesiastical power. But they also extend it to future Rome. They note that ancient
                    pagan Rome alone doesn't fit (because in the pagan era, the prophecy of seven kings and ten
                    horns wasn't fulfilled) <sup>40</sup>. Therefore, Rome in its papal and end-time form is meant. The
                    "wisdom" needed is to see that a religious system called Babylon can be headquartered in
                    Rome, even as that system transcends a single city. Indeed, Roman Catholicism, though
                    global, is quintessentially linked to the city of Rome - fulfilling "sits on seven mountains."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: God requires us to use "the mind with wisdom" when handling prophetic
                    symbols. We should be cautious interpreters - neither ignoring clear clues (like Rome's seven
                    hills) nor leaning on wild imagination. Historically, many godly people did have this wisdom:
                    they recognized the corruptions of Rome as "Babylon" and separated from them. The
                    challenge for us: do we have the courage of that wisdom? It's one thing to identify Babylon;
                    it's another to "come out of her" (Rev 18:4). Also, consider the broader principle: the harlot
                    sitting on mountains may hint that false religion often tries to root itself in worldly power
                    centers (the "mountains" of influence). True faith, however, looks for a city whose builder is
                    God (Hebrews 11:10). Are we overly attached to earthly "mountains" (places of prestige,
                    cultural power)? The wisdom from above would keep us focused on the Kingdom of God
                    rather than the citadels of human civilization.

                <h2>Verse 10 - Seven Kings: Five Fallen, One Present, One to Come (Then
                    an Eighth)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"There are also seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And when he
                    comes, he must continue a short time."</span> Still speaking of the seven heads, the angel now explains them as
                    seven kings (or kingdoms/ruling powers). This appears to describe a sequence of seven regimes related in
                    some way to the beast. The angel breaks it down: five are fallen, one is (currently), the other has not yet come,
                    and when the seventh comes it will be brief. Let's decode this in context:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since the harlot is clearly connected to Rome, many interpreters understand these seven "kings" as forms
                    of government or phases of rule over the Roman Empire (or broadly, world empires culminating in Rome).
                    A common view (noted by many, including brethren expositors) is that the "five fallen" could refer to five
                    successive phases of Roman governance that had passed by John's time. Some historical suggestions: (1)
                    Kings (the early regal period of Rome), (2) Consuls, (3) Dictators, (4) Triumvirs (or perhaps Decemvirs), (5)
                    Imperial (Julius/ Augustus) - though the counting varies in different analyses. The "one is" would then be
                    the form in place in John's day, which was the imperial rule (the emperors - Caesar Domitian likely at the
                    time of writing). In fact, William Kelly explicitly interprets: "the sixth head (reigning in that day) was the
                    imperial form of government" <sup>41</sup>. Darby concurs that "it was the existing authority in the time of prophecy:
                    five... had fallen; one was there" <sup>42</sup> - clearly the "one is" = the Roman Empire of the first century.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then "the other (seventh) has not yet come; and when he comes, he must continue a short space." This predicts a
                    seventh form of the beast's kingdom that would arise after John's time and last only a little while. Brethren
                    commentators have sometimes speculated on this. Remarkably, writing in the 1800s, Darby suggested:
                    "My impression is that the first Napoleon and his brief empire is the seventh" <sup>43</sup>, which indeed was a short-lived
                    revival of empire. Whether or not that is correct, it shows the expectation that after the long papal period
                    (which isn't counted among these heads in their view), there could be a short-lived attempt at empire
                    (Napoleon's), and then the final revival. In any case, the wording implies the seventh will be brief ("must
                    remain a little while"). Perhaps it could be a short re-organization of the Roman domain before the final
                    Antichrist - or even a future transitional government before the beast's full manifestation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now, the eighth is mentioned in the next verse, but verse 10 sets it up: The beast itself in its end-time
                    satanic revival is going to be an anomaly - in one sense the 7th, in another an 8th (we discuss in verse 11).
                    Essentially, by the end of verse 10 we have: 5 past, 1 present (the imperial Rome of John's day), and 1
                    future short-lived. These make seven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    An alternative approach sees these as seven major empires in biblical history that oppressed God's
                    people, with Rome being the sixth ("one is" in John's time) and a future coalition as the seventh. Some list:
                    Egypt, Assyria, Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece (that's five fallen by John's time), Rome (one is), and then a
                    future revived Roman-based empire (the seventh). This scheme too yields seven, with an eighth being the
                    final Antichrist's kingdom (though it's basically the same as seventh revived). Both views ultimately converge
                    on the idea: We are heading toward the final phase of the beast, which is rooted in the Roman
                    context. Kelly emphasizes that no past historical application fits all details, so "for the fulfilment of the
                    prophecy, we must look onward to the latter day" <sup>44 45</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We must hold these identifications humbly, but the angel clearly wanted John to see a continuum of power:
                    by John's time some phases were already history ("5 fallen"), his present was the 6th, and there was more to
                    come. This reassures us that God knows the end from the beginning - the rise and fall of empires are on
                    His timeline.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The exact identification of the seven heads/kings has been debated, but what's
                    doctrinally clear is that God had a sovereign plan for the Roman beast. Many brethren
                    writers identify the "five fallen" as previous Roman governmental forms, "one is" as the
                    then-current empire, and "another yet to come" as a future government that will precede
                    the final Antichrist. They see a possible gap or transition representing the Church Age (when
                    the Roman Empire "is not" in full beast form) and then an end-time resurgence. The key point
                    is that the beast's rule goes through stages culminating in a final satanically empowered
                    phase. And however men list them, the final phase is short ("a short space") - implying that
                    when the last empire comes, events will move quickly (cf. the Tribulation period).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: This verse reminds us that world kingdoms are temporary. "Five have fallen" -
                    the mightiest empires eventually crumble. Only God's kingdom is eternal. The one that
                    "is" (for John, Rome) seemed invincible, but it too passed away. Believers should not put hope
                    in any earthly empire. Also, note God's hand even in the duration: the seventh "must continue
                    a short time" - God sets a limit on the last human empire before Christ returns. Evil will have
                    its brief hour, but only as God permits. This encourages patience and trust; when we see
                    nations raging, we know they operate on God's timetable, not their own. Finally, "here is
                    wisdom" for us: reading history (the fallen five) in light of prophecy (the future seventh and
                    eighth) helps us avoid being overly impressed by present powers. We can say of any regime,
                    "It was, and is not" (or soon will not be). Therefore, we fix our eyes on Jesus, the true King,
                    whose kingdom "shall never be destroyed" (Daniel 2:44).

                <h2>Verse 11 - The Beast as an Eighth King (of the Seven)</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And the beast that was, and is not, is himself also the eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to
                    perdition."</span> This somewhat cryptic statement wraps up the explanation of the heads. It reveals that the
                    beast, in its end-time form, will be a kind of "eighth" king, yet it belongs to the seven. How can this be? The
                    angel indicates a paradox: the final incarnation of the beast is both one of the seven (not an entirely new
                    entity) and yet an eighth (in the sense of an unprecedented resurgence). William Kelly elucidates: the
                    beast "in one sense [is] an eighth, in another sense it is of the seven; 'eighth' perhaps, because of its extraordinary
                    resurrection character, yet 'one of the seven' because it is old imperialism revived" <sup>46</sup>. In other words, the final
                    world empire under Antichrist will essentially be a revived Roman Empire (thus part of the historic "seven"
                    regimes of Rome ‚Äì likely the same as the 7th head coming back), but its revival is so remarkable (coming
                    from the abyss with new satanic power) that it can be labeled an "eighth" king. It's an extraordinary
                    extension of the series.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Think of it this way: if the seven heads were successive governments, the beast's return is the return of one
                    of those heads (the imperial) in a new form. It "is of the seven" - meaning it's the same basic beastly empire,
                    not an entirely different civilization - it's Rome again. Yet it's the eighth - because it's a new embodiment of
                    that empire after a long gap and with demonic power. This is consistent with Revelation 13: the beast's
                    mortal wound (to one of its heads) is healed, so that head (the imperial power) lives again as an "eighth."
                </p>
                <p>
                    The verse then solemnly repeats the beast's destiny: it "is going to perdition." Despite its rebirth and short-
                    lived domination, its doom is sure. The word "perdition" was used of Judas (the "son of perdition") and is
                    used of the Antichrist (2 Thessalonians 2:3 calls him the "son of perdition"). It implies not just destruction
                    but being sent to eternal judgment. Indeed, in Revelation 19:20 the beast is cast alive into the lake of fire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, verse 11 essentially summarizes: the final Antichristian empire = a resurrected Roman Empire (one
                    of the previous seven) which, by virtue of its revival, can be considered an "eighth" world power - and its end
                    will be utter destruction by God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, we can observe that the Roman imperial idea never quite died ‚Äì the "Holy Roman Empire,"
                    various European empires, etc., all tried to revive Rome's legacy. But prophecy suggests a final, full revival is
                    coming. We see shadows even in organizations like the EU, but the ultimate fulfillment awaits the
                    Antichrist's arrival.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The beast being "of the seven" yet "an eighth" underscores that Antichrist's
                    kingdom will be a revival, not a brand-new civilization. It will likely involve the same
                    geographic core (Europe/Rome) and cultural heritage of the old Roman Empire. This puts to
                    rest theories that the Beast's empire is something totally unrelated to Rome. Brethren writers
                    firmly plant the Beast in the Roman context. Darby wrote, "Of itself this marks the Roman or
                    Latin Empire, only it will reappear more formally" <sup>47</sup>. The "eighth" also hints at the beast's
                    counterfeit nature - "8" in the Bible sometimes signifies a new beginning (e.g., Christ rose on
                    the first day of a new week, effectively an eighth day). Here the Beast mimics a "new
                    beginning" for the empire, but it's a satanic one. In contrast, Christ's kingdom is often
                    associated with the number 8 in a positive sense (new creation). Satan's final attempt at a new
                    world order will likewise be an "eighth" - an imitation destined to fail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: God is not fooled by appearances or pretenses. The world may hail the final
                    empire as something entirely new and hopeful (perhaps touting it as a new era of peace or
                    unity), but God labels it plainly: it's just the old beast back again, and headed for perdition. We
                    need that discernment. Also, consider how this principle applies spiritually: sometimes old
                    sins or ideologies repackage themselves as "new" (an eighth), but in reality they are "of the
                    seven" ‚Äì the same old lies. We should be wary of "new" doctrines or movements that are
                    really just revived errors from the past. Lastly, the beast's certain perdition is a comfort to
                    believers. No matter how powerful evil seems, its doom is sealed. When we see evil
                    "resurrect" in our day (whether in society or personal struggles), we can trust that Christ will
                    ultimately triumph. The eighth will go to perdition, but "of His kingdom there shall be no end"
                    (Luke 1:33).
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 12 - The Ten Horns: Future Kings Allied with the Beast</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"The ten horns which you saw are ten kings who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive
                    authority for one hour as kings with the beast."</span> Now the angel turns to the ten horns on the beast.
                    Horns in prophetic imagery typically represent kings or kingdoms (Daniel 7:24). Here we are told plainly: the
                    ten horns are ten kings. Importantly, in John's time these kings had "no kingdom as yet" - meaning they
                    are future from John's perspective. They will receive royal authority at the same time ("one hour") as the
                    beast's final manifestation. In other words, this indicates a future confederation of ten co-ruling kings or
                    kingdoms that will arise concurrently and join under the beast's leadership.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This detail aligns perfectly with Daniel 7:24, which foretold that the Roman beast's ten horns are ten kings
                    who will arise. Historically, people have often tried to identify the ten horns with ten nations that came out
                    of the Roman Empire's breakup. For example, after Rome fell, various barbarian kingdoms (Visigoths,
                    Vandals, etc.) emerged - sometimes listed as ten. However, the angel's explanation shows a crucial point:
                    these ten kings reign "with the beast" simultaneously <sup>48</sup>, not simply sequentially or apart from him.
                    William Kelly stresses that in history, when the Western Roman Empire fell and fragmented into multiple
                    kingdoms, "they received their power as kings when the Beast ceased to exist. Thus the difference is complete
                    between past history and the certain fulfillment of the prophecy in the future" <sup>49</sup>. In other words, in past
                    history the Roman Empire and the independent kings did not coexist - one replaced the other. But in the
                    future, prophecy requires a scenario where a central imperial power (the Beast) and ten regional kings are
                    all ruling together for a brief period. This has never happened yet, which strongly indicates a future
                    fulfillment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The phrase "one hour" suggests a short, specific timeframe of joint rule - likely the final period (perhaps
                    the Great Tribulation, often thought of as 3.5 years). It emphasizes how quickly these events will unfold
                    once the coalition forms. The ten kings receive authority with the beast implying they willingly share
                    power under his supremacy. Possibly, these could be ten nations or regions (perhaps a ten-nation
                    federation or ten blocs in a future world government) that unite under the Antichrist's empire. Some have
                    speculated about organizations like the EU having ten core nations, etc., but the prophecy will ultimately
                    fulfill exactly as written when the time comes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Importantly, these kings "have not yet received a kingdom" in John's day. This demolishes any interpretation
                    that tries to force the ten horns into ancient history. It also suggests that any current identifications (say,
                    ten specific countries today) might be premature until the Beast himself is on the scene. The number ten
                    could be literal or symbolic of completeness; however, given the precision of prophecy, many expect a literal
                    ten-nation alliance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The ten horns show that the final world empire is not an absolute monarchy in
                    isolation; it is a coalition of rulers. This corresponds to the ten toes of Nebuchadnezzar's
                    statue (Daniel 2:41-44), which were part iron, part clay ‚Äì a divided kingdom partly strong,
                    partly brittle. The Brethren writers note that any attempt to see a perfect fulfillment in the
                    past (like the ten Germanic tribes of the 5th century) falls short, because those tribes did not
                    reign concurrently with a Roman emperor <sup>49</sup>. Therefore, we expect a future ten-
                    kingdom structure. It speaks of a kind of "restored" Roman Empire in federal form - likely
                    some new political arrangement where multiple leaders govern under the Antichrist's
                    authority. This makes sense in a modern context (e.g., a union of states).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: God controls the rise of kings. These ten will only receive power at the ordained
                    "one hour." We can trust that world events ‚Äì alliances, unions of nations ‚Äì are moving under
                    God's sovereign hand toward His predetermined end. As believers, we should neither be
                    alarmist nor oblivious. When we see nations coalescing or talks of global governance, we
                    shouldn't jump to conclusions, but we should recall this prophecy. It teaches us to have a
                    balanced view: God's plan includes human political developments (He foretold them), yet His
                    people's hope isn't in any political union but in Christ's return. Also, the "one hour" of shared
                    authority reminds us how fleeting worldly power is. These leaders will enjoy power briefly. So
                    why envy or fear the powerful? Psalm 37: "fret not... for they shall soon wither." Instead of
                    fretting about emerging superstates or conspiracies, Christians stay informed but calm,
                    knowing that nothing can happen outside God's "hour" and plan.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 13 - Unified Purpose: Giving Power to the Beast</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"These are of one mind, and they will give their power and authority to the beast."</span> The angel here
                    reveals the unity of purpose among the ten kings. Though they are ten separate rulers, "they are of one
                    mind." They willingly subordinate their individual sovereignty to the Beast's leadership. In practical terms,
                    this suggests a future coalition where national leaders unanimously cede authority to a single supreme
                    leader (the Antichrist). They form something like a federal empire: ten kings acting in lockstep,
                    surrendering their armies, resources, and political clout to the central imperial figure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a remarkable contrast to historical reality. Typically, alliances of nations are full of rivalries and
                    conflicting agendas. But prophecy indicates that at least for a short period, these ten will be completely
                    aligned ‚Äì likely galvanized by the charismatic, domineering presence of Antichrist and perhaps by external
                    pressures (like the judgments occurring or the threat of the Lamb's coming). Darby notes: "They all give their
                    power to the beast" <sup>50</sup>. This means the beast (the Antichrist) will effectively wield the combined might of all
                    ten kingdoms as one. It's a picture of extreme centralized power - a final attempt at world dominion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We see foreshadows in history: for example, how European nations sometimes band together under a
                    strong leader (think of Napoleon's vassal kings, or Hitler's Axis allies). But those fell apart due to mistrust. In
                    the end times, God will put it into these kings' hearts (as verse 17 will say) to wholeheartedly cooperate.
                    They will likely institute a one-world government (or at least one-world in the scope of the old Roman
                    domain, which could be quite extensive). Such unity of secular powers against God's purposes is seen also
                    in Psalm 2: "The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD and
                    against His Anointed." Here we have ten kings counselled together with one mind ‚Äì a fulfillment of that
                    pattern.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, what they intend for evil, God will use for good (namely, to fulfill prophetic purposes, as we'll see
                    in verse 17).
                </p>
                <p>
                    For now, verse 13 sets up the climax: with their combined strength given to the beast, the stage is set for
                    direct conflict with Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The voluntary unity of these kings under the beast underscores how Antichrist
                    will achieve global dominance not just by conquest but by consent (at least initially). It
                    fulfills what Daniel 17:12 predicted (ten kings arise, and presumably the little horn/Antichrist
                    arises among them and gains preeminence). The one mind could indicate political
                    unanimity or even a strong delusion causing them to all adopt the beast's agenda. It shows
                    the extent of human rebellion: many nations acting as one in defiance of God. This
                    anticipates the battle of Armageddon where "the kings of the earth and of the whole world"
                    gather together (Rev 16:14) under demonic influence to war against Christ. Theologically, it
                    demonstrates the principle that satanic unity can exist ‚Äì the enemies of God will
                    momentarily set aside differences to fight the Lamb.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Unity is powerful for good or for ill. Here we see a unity of the wicked, a
                    counterfeit of the unity of the Spirit believers enjoy. It's sobering: just as Christians are called
                    to be of one mind in Christ (Phil 2:2), the world will one day be of one mind in Antichrist. We
                    should strive for godly unity and be wary of false unity movements. Not every call for
                    "global unity" is benign; when unity is based on rejecting God's truth, it becomes a tool for
                    Antichrist. Already, we observe trends of centralizing authority (in governance, economics,
                    even religion) - believers should discern the spirit behind calls for unity at the expense of
                    truth. Also, personally: are we "of one mind" with the agenda of this world or with the agenda
                    of Christ? James 4:4 warns friendship with the world is enmity with God. In the end, there will
                    be no middle ground ‚Äì one either sides with the Beast or with the Lamb. This verse
                    challenges us to examine where our allegiance and "mindset" lie.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 14 - War Against the Lamb, and the Lamb's Victory</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and
                    King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful."</span> Here we reach the
                    culmination of the harlot/beast vision: the ten kings and the beast, unified in purpose, turn their aggression
                    toward "the Lamb" - a title of Christ in Revelation emphasizing His sacrificial death and meekness, yet also
                    His ultimate triumph. The phrase "make war with the Lamb" alludes to the climactic battle when Christ
                    returns (Revelation 19:19: "the kings of the earth and their armies gathered to make war against Him who
                    sat on the horse"). This shows that the final world empire and its allies will literally attempt to fight Jesus
                    Christ at His Second Coming ‚Äì likely by attacking His people and perhaps even gathering to fight Him
                    directly as He appears. It's the zenith of human rebellion: the armies of earth trying to overthrow the King of
                    Heaven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yet the outcome is never in doubt: "the Lamb will overcome them." Praise God - gentle Lamb though He
                    may be, He is also the Lion of Judah. His meekness in redemption will be matched by His majesty in
                    judgment. The text gives the reason: "for He is Lord of lords and King of kings." All earthly lords and kings
                    (including the beast and his ten kings) are ultimately subordinate to Jesus, the sovereign over all. This title
                    "King of kings and Lord of lords" is one of Christ's highest titles, also seen written on His robe in Revelation
                    19:16. It means no coalition of rulers, no matter how powerful, can prevail against Him, because He is
                    the supreme authority in the universe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Beautifully, we're also told that when Christ comes to defeat the beast, His followers come with Him:
                    "those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful." This refers to the saints ‚Äì likely the raptured
                    Church and possibly angels too, but the triple description (called, chosen, faithful) fits believers. They are
                    "called" by God's grace, "chosen" (elect) in Christ, and "faithful" in their life and testimony (proved genuine
                    by perseverance). What an encouragement: when Jesus returns, we will be with Him (cf. Rev 19:14, "the
                    armies in heaven, clothed in fine linen, followed Him on white horses"). We don't win the victory; He wins it
                    - but we share in His triumph.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darby comments on this scene: despised as Christ may be now, "He shall overcome them," and "there are
                    others coming with Him, not merely angels, but called ones, His saints." <sup>51</sup>. The Brethren often taught that the
                    Church, having been caught up to meet Christ (in the rapture), will return with Him in glory to reign.
                    (Colossians 3:4, 1 Thess 3:13). Here is a direct evidence of that: the Lamb's companions share His titles in a
                    derivative way (Revelation 19:14's fine linen was the righteousness of saints). They reign with Him
                    (Revelation 20:4). But in the actual battle, Christ alone treads the winepress (Isaiah 63:3, Rev 19:15) - we are
                    just joyful witnesses to His victory.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So verse 14 gives the concluding spoiler: despite Babylon's intrigues and the beast's terrifying power, Jesus
                    Christ ("the Lamb") wins. This is doctrinally central. God allows evil a short reign, but Christ will utterly
                    conquer. The rest of Revelation will give details (chapter 19), but here the end is summarized so we have no
                    doubts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: Christ's sovereignty and victory are the ultimate themes here. "Lord of lords, King
                    of kings" affirms His deity and omnipotence - titles used of God in the Old Testament (e.g.,
                    Deut 10:17). It's a strong testimony that Jesus, the Lamb, is none other than the Almighty God
                    who has absolute dominion. Theologically, this also highlights the bond between Christ and
                    His people: He doesn't come alone; His "called, chosen, faithful" ones are inseparable from
                    Him. It implies the doctrine of glorification - the saints, having been called and chosen, have
                    also been made faithful (by His grace) and will partake in His triumph. Also, note the contrast:
                    the beast had ten kings "of one mind" with him; Jesus has saints with Him who are "faithful."
                    The beast's followers are coerced or deluded; Jesus' followers are willing and loyal. Another
                    subtlety: Christ is called "Lamb" even in war, signifying that His victory comes through His
                    sacrificial work (the very reason He can judge is that He first redeemed).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: This verse is deeply encouraging. No matter how dark the times, we know the
                    ending: "The Lamb will overcome them." When evil forces seem to be winning, remember that
                    our Lord is King of kings ‚Äì every ruler, every tyrant is under Him and will answer to Him. If
                    you ever feel in the minority or powerless as a Christian, recall that one Lamb defeats ten
                    kings and a beast in one stroke. Also, take heart that you are "called and chosen" - God has
                    set you apart to belong to Christ's victorious company. Strive therefore to be "faithful." That
                    is the one part of the description we must actively live out. We can ask: Am I living as one of
                    the called, chosen, and faithful? When Jesus returns, will I be arrayed in the fine linen of
                    practical righteousness (Rev 19:8) following Him? This hope of victory should fuel our
                    perseverance now. Furthermore, the unity of the ten kings for evil reminds us to be united
                    with Christ and our brethren for good ‚Äì we want to be found "of one mind" with the Lamb,
                    not with the world. The Lamb's victory is our victory; let's live boldly and loyally in that
                    assurance.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 15 - The Waters Interpreted as Peoples and Nations</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"Then he said to me, 'The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes,
                    nations, and tongues.""</span> The angel now clarifies the first symbol mentioned back in verse 1: the "many
                    waters" upon which the harlot sits. As suspected, it is a metaphor for the vast multitude of humanity
                    under her influence. "Peoples, multitudes, nations, and tongues" is a fourfold expression basically covering
                    all categories of mankind - it emphasizes the universality of Babylon's sway. The false religious system isn't
                    confined to one ethnic or linguistic group; it has worldwide scope. In John's day, Rome indeed sat on "many
                    waters" in the sense that the Roman Church eventually spread across many nations, and more broadly, false
                    religion spans the globe. Darby's commentary explicitly notes: "The waters are explained as peoples,
                    multitudes, nations, and tongues ‚Äì masses of populations in their diverse divisions." <sup>52</sup>. This shows that
                    Babylon's power base is the population of the world, especially the unregenerate masses ("those who dwell
                    on the earth" who were mentioned as being intoxicated with her in verse 2).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This interpretation also connects to Jeremiah 51:13, which addressed historical Babylon: "O you who dwell by
                    many waters, abundant in treasures..." - ancient Babylon literally sat on the Euphrates and its canals, but
                    mystic Babylon "dwells" on the seas of peoples. Essentially, Babylon thrives on the support of the world's
                    populace and its cultures. She influences multitudes and draws her strength from them, much as a city
                    draws prosperity from the trade of many waters.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For our study, verse 15 is straightforward because the angel himself decodes it. It reinforces the earlier
                    understanding of verse 2 and verse 1. It also sets the stage for verse 16: now that we know "waters" = the
                    peoples, and that the harlot sits on them (implying she rules or heavily influences them), we can appreciate
                    how dramatic it will be when the beast and kings turn on her - they will strip her of that position over the
                    peoples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: The harlot's "sitting" on the waters indicates her dominion over the world's
                    peoples in religious matters. This verse teaches the global nature of end-times apostasy. The
                    false church isn't a local aberration; it will encompass nations and languages ‚Äì a counterfeit
                    "great commission," if you will, making disciples of all nations but in a false religion. It
                    reminds us of the worldwide extent of Roman Catholic influence historically (truly a multi-
                    national church), and perhaps in the future that influence will expand or merge with other
                    religious movements to literally cover the globe. It's sobering to think of the majority of the
                    world's population being under the spell of Babylon (as Rev 13:8 says, all whose names are
                    not in the Book of Life will worship the beast or his image).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: First, this reveals the urgency of the Gospel mission. If Babylon sits on
                    "peoples, multitudes, nations, tongues," then people everywhere are in spiritual danger of
                    deception. We must labor to call individuals out of Babylon into the marvelous light of Christ.
                    Second, it's a check on any complacency: large numbers do not equal truth. Just because
                    something is popular among "many peoples" doesn't mean it's of God - in fact, here the vast
                    multitudes are aligned with the harlot. True faith may often be a faithful remnant, not the
                    popular majority. Third, this interpretation assures us that God's Word can be understood ‚Äì
                    symbols like waters have clear meaning as defined by Scripture. It encourages us to study
                    Scripture carefully and let it interpret itself. When facing confusing imagery in our own life or
                    dreams or ideas, we should seek God's interpretation through His Word. Finally, personally:
                    does the harlot influence me? She sits on multitudes ‚Äì are we inadvertently part of those
                    "waters"? We should examine whether any Babylonish beliefs or practices have subtly swayed
                    us because "everyone is doing it." Remember, "peoples, multitudes" may follow Babylon, but
                    we are called to follow the Lamb (even if it's against the flow of the majority).
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 16 - The Harlot's Destruction by Her Former Allies</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And the ten horns which you saw on the beast, these will hate the harlot, make her desolate and
                    naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire."</span> Here a dramatic twist is revealed: the very ten kings (horns)
                    that initially supported the harlot will turn against her. The angel prophesies a violent betrayal: the secular
                    powers will "hate" the harlot (grow to abhor her) and utterly devastate her. The language is graphic and
                    final:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Make her desolate and naked" - they will strip away all her wealth, adornment, and support,
                        exposing her shame. Desolate implies robbing her of resources and followers; naked implies public
                        humiliation (she who sat as a queen in luxury is reduced to nothing).</li>
                    <li>"Eat her flesh" - a figurative way to say they will devour her completely, perhaps plundering her
                        treasures and consuming all that sustained her (just as wild beasts eat the flesh of a prey). This
                        echoes Old Testament judgment language; for example, in Psalm 27:2 enemies came to "eat up my
                        flesh" - meaning to utterly destroy.</li>
                    <li>"Burn her with fire" - they will burn the city/system to the ground. In ancient law, the punishment
                        for a harlot (and for a priest's daughter who played the harlot) could be burning (Leviticus 21:9). Also,
                        burning a city indicates total judgment (like God's destruction of Sodom or Jericho). So the kings will
                        be God's instruments to reduce Babylon to ashes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This is a stunning turn of events. Initially, the harlot rides the beast - indicating the empire tolerated and
                    carried her. But something changes during Antichrist's reign: the political powers grow to resent the
                    religious Babylon. Many expositors suggest that once the Antichrist (the Beast) declares himself god (2
                    Thess 2:4, and sets up the abomination of desolation), he will no longer brook any rival, even an apostate
                    church. He and his vassal kings will dismantle the false church to establish direct worship of the Beast.
                    The harlot ‚Äì initially useful to unite people religiously ‚Äì becomes unnecessary or even an obstacle to the
                    Beast's own divine pretensions. Thus, God sovereignly puts it into their hearts (v17) to destroy her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, we can see foreshadows: secular rulers at times chafed under papal authority and eventually
                    broke with it (e.g., the rise of nationalism, the stripping of church lands, etc.). Here it's the consummation:
                    the world rulers violently overthrow the religious system. In one hour she is made desolate (Rev 18:17).
                    Note, Revelation 18 will describe in detail the fall and burning of Babylon (though it emphasizes more the
                    economic aspect). But here we know who causes her fall: not believers (they're told to come out, not fight
                    her), but her own former political lovers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Darby captures the scene: "the ten horns... and the beast hate the whore and eat her flesh and burn her with
                    fire" <sup>52</sup>. This shows that ultimately, secular powers despise the false church - once they have use for her
                    no longer, they turn savagely. It's poetic justice: she rode them for gain; now they buck her off and trample
                    her.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: God's judgments are often carried out by the hands of the wicked themselves. Here
                    Babylon's judgment comes via the Beast and his kings. This fulfills God's Word: "they shall
                    hate the harlot" and burn her - reminiscent of how ancient Israel's harlotry was punished by
                    the nations she enticed (Ezekiel 16:37-41 prophesied that Israel's lovers would turn on her
                    and strip her naked and burn her houses). It also aligns with the ten horns being partly iron,
                    partly clay (Daniel 2): the alliance is unstable and eventually fractures, leading to Babylon's
                    ruin. This verse is key in dispensational understanding: it distinguishes the fall of
                    ecclesiastical Babylon (chapter 17) by the Beast's hand, from the fall of commercial/
                    political Babylon (chapter 18) by God's direct wrath at the end. However, they likely occur in
                    close sequence. Theologically, note that evil contains the seeds of its own destruction. The
                    beast's regime destroys Babylon (evil vs evil), then God destroys the beast.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: There are several sobering lessons. First, compromise with the world is fatal.
                    The harlot thought riding the beast would bring her power; in the end, the beast devoured
                    her. Churches today that cozy up to secular power or dilute truth for influence might gain for
                    a while, but they risk destruction by the very world they court. Second, we see the principle
                    that ungodly alliances never last. The kings and Babylon turn on each other; there is no
                    honor among thieves. For personal life: if we base relationships or ventures on sin or
                    expediency rather than God's way, eventually it will implode. Third, note the complete
                    judgment: despised ("hate"), deprived ("desolate and naked"), destroyed ("eat flesh, burn with
                    fire"). God's judgment on false religion is total. This should instill a holy fear - He is patient,
                    but finally Babylon's sins reach heaven (Rev 18:5) and judgment is irrevocable. Lastly, on a
                    hopeful note: verse 16 implies the demise of false, oppressive religion. All the corruption
                    that has plagued true faith will be removed. Sometimes we get discouraged by religious
                    hypocrisy and abuse; God promises He will deal with it decisively. Our job is to "come out of
                    her" (18:4) and stay pure, trusting that God will handle Babylon's fall.
                </p>

                <h2>Verse 17 - God's Sovereign Plan Behind the Scenes</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their
                    kingdom to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled."</span> Here the angel reveals the divine sovereignty
                    orchestrating these events. Why do the ten kings suddenly unite under the Beast and then turn against the
                    harlot? Because God put it in their hearts to carry out His purpose. This is a profound statement of how
                    God's providence can operate even through wicked rulers. They freely choose to ally with Antichrist and to
                    destroy Babylon out of hatred, yet over and above their choices, God is using their actions to accomplish
                    His prophetic Word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, God's purpose was twofold here: (1) to bring the ten kings under one mind (united under the Beast's
                    authority), and (2) to use them as instruments to judge the harlot. They "give their kingdom to the beast" ‚Äì
                    we saw that in verse 13 ‚Äì and they will do so "until the words of God are fulfilled." That implies there is a
                    divinely appointed duration for the Beast's reign (often understood as the 42 months of Rev 13:5). When
                    that time is up (when all God's prophetic words are accomplished), then the Beast and kings themselves will
                    face judgment (at Armageddon by Christ).
                </p>
                <p>
                    This verse is comforting: it shows God is in ultimate control even during the darkest hour of tribulation.
                    The rise of Antichrist's empire and the fall of Babylon are not random; they happen "for God has put it in their
                    hearts" to act according to His will. This does not excuse their evil (they act from hatred and pride), but it
                    shows God's sovereignty is so great that He can steer even the wrath of man to praise Him (Psalm 76:10).
                    It's akin to how God stirred the hearts of pagan kings like Cyrus (Ezra 1:1) to fulfill His word, or how He
                    allowed nations to judge Israel yet later judged those nations for their violence (Zech 1:15).
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the end, "the words of God" ‚Äì all the prophecies ‚Äì will be fulfilled precisely. Not one will fail. The
                    destruction of Babylon was prophesied (e.g., Rev 14:8, "Babylon is fallen"), and God ensures its fulfillment by
                    guiding events. Likewise, the dominance of the Beast for a short time is prophesied and is permitted
                    precisely until that prophetic word is accomplished, no longer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This verse also answers any question of "why would God let the Beast and ten kings do this?" It's part of His
                    judgment on Babylon and the final act of the drama of human history. As soon as the harlot is out of the
                    way, the stage is set for Christ's return to judge the Beast's empire (Rev 19).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: Providence and Predestination are at work here. We see that God can "put it into
                    the hearts" of rulers to carry out His decree <sup>3</sup>. This doesn't mean He makes them evil;
                    rather, He guides their existing evil intentions to align with His timing and plan. It's like
                    Proverbs 21:1, "The king's heart is in the hand of the Lord... He turns it wherever He wishes." This
                    interplay of divine sovereignty and human free agency is a mystery, but Revelation affirms
                    both. The kings choose to give allegiance to the Beast (they are responsible for that), yet God
                    ordained it to fulfill His word. The phrase "until the words of God are fulfilled" underscores
                    the inerrancy and certainty of God's prophetic Word. Every prophecy about Babylon and
                    the Beast will come to pass to the letter, because God Himself ensures it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We can take great comfort that God's plan cannot be thwarted. Even when evil
                    seems rampant, God is still ruling. The worst schemes of Satan will inadvertently serve God's
                    ends. When we watch world events that are troubling (wars, plots, persecutions), we should
                    remember God's "purpose" is being worked out. This doesn't make evil good, but it means evil
                    never escapes God's control. Also, the kings had "one mind" to do evil (echoing verse 13), and
                    that was from God in the sense of permission and direction. Conversely, we pray God would
                    put in our hearts His will to do good. Just as He can direct evil hearts to unknowingly carry out
                    His judgment, He can direct willing hearts to knowingly carry out His commission. Are we
                    yielding to His prompting? Another lesson: patience in waiting for "the words of God" to be
                    fulfilled. There was a specific "until" in God's plan. We often ask, "How long, O Lord?" (Rev
                    6:10). This verse implies God has an "until" for everything. He waits until the perfect moment.
                    So we must trust His timing. Lastly, we see the necessity of knowing God's Word. It was by
                    knowing the prophetic "words of God" that the early church recognized events (like Christ's
                    first coming). Similarly, those who understand these prophecies during the end times will not
                    be dismayed; they will say, "This is exactly what God said would happen." We too should
                    familiarize ourselves with God's promises and prophecies, so that as history unfolds, our faith
                    is strengthened by seeing His Word fulfilled, rather than shaken.

                <h2>Verse 18 - The Woman Identified as the Great City Ruling the
                    Earth's Kings</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And the woman whom you saw is that great city which reigns over the kings of the earth."</span> The
                    angel's final statement removes any lingering ambiguity about the harlot's identity. "The woman... is the
                    great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth." In John's time (circa 1st century A.D.), only one
                    city could be described in those terms: Rome. Rome was the seat of a vast empire, the city that "reigned"
                    over earthly kings and nations. Indeed, Roman emperors held sway over client kings and governors
                    worldwide. William Kelly affirms: "Rome in some form is the woman described in the chapter. The seven heads
                    or hills clearly point to that city, which of all cities was known as ruling over the kings of the earth." <sup>22</sup>. Darby
                    likewise concludes: "the woman... is Rome" <sup>53</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, scripture itself confirms the interpretation: Mystery Babylon = Rome (especially in its religious
                    aspect). But notice, it says "the great city which reigns (present tense) over the kings of the earth" - John
                    wrote this likely during the Roman Empire's heyday (possibly under Domitian), so the angel is virtually
                    pointing a finger at Rome. Early Christian readers likely understood this, though they had to be cautious in
                    openly saying so (hence the code-name "Babylon").
                </p>
                <p>
                    This identification also provides a bridge: it is Rome - yet not merely pagan Rome, because the context of a
                    harlot false religion in league with empire suggests Christianized Rome (the Papal system) that came later.
                    Some have noted that in Revelation 17 John is astonished because he's essentially seeing what had been the
                    church of Rome turned into a bloodthirsty harlot. In John's time, the "church" was still pure and persecuted,
                    not persecuting. The prophecy foresaw a time when Rome, after professing Christianity (Rome papal, the
                    Vatican), would corrupt truth and persecute saints, all while still being identified with the ancient city of
                    seven hills. This indeed happened in history, confirming the prophecy. And it will reach its zenith in the final
                    days.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By calling her a "city," the angel also hints at Babylon's worldly, political dimension (which chapter 18 will
                    expand on, describing the wealth and commerce of Babylon). So the religious system is intertwined with an
                    actual city/civilization (Rome). In a sense, Babylon (Rome) is both a city and a system (religious and
                    economic). The Bible sometimes personifies cities as women (Jerusalem as the adulterous wife in Ezekiel 16,
                    for example). Here the city of Rome is personified as the harlot.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This verse also ties back to Revelation 16:19, which mentioned "the great city" and "Babylon the great." It's
                    confirmed they are one: the great city Babylon = Rome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With this identification, chapter 17 concludes. We now know: the harlot is Rome (the apostate religious
                    system emanating from Rome), and she will be judged by the Beast and kings, as part of God's plan, prior to
                    Christ's return. What follows in chapter 18 is a lament over Babylon's fall, likely looking at it from an earthly
                    perspective.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Doctrine: This verse solidifies the historic Protestant interpretation that the Papal Roman
                    Church is in view. The Reformers openly said, "Rome is Babylon." Brethren authors like Kelly
                    and Darby, though more focused on future fulfillment, fully concur that Rome is intended <sup>22
                    53</sup>. It's doctrinally significant that Revelation pinpoints a city - Christianity is unique among
                    religions in having a city (Vatican/Rome) at the core of a powerful religious hierarchy that
                    endured through ages. Another doctrinal point: God sees not just systems but actual places.
                    Judgment is coming on an actual location (Rome) for its spiritual crimes. This parallels OT
                    prophecies where specific cities (Babylon, Tyre, Nineveh) were judged. It reminds us God is
                    the Lord of history and geography.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: "The great city reigning over the kings" - think of the arrogance and influence of
                    that city. It should humble us that even the mightiest city is nothing before God when it
                    becomes proud. Rome, the marvel of the world, becomes a byword for harlotry in Scripture.
                    Let that warn modern cities and institutions: any city or nation that exalts itself and corrupts
                    truth can become 'Babylon' and will face a fall. On a personal level, this identification
                    challenges us: Do we recognize Babylon for what it is? Early Christians had to discern that
                    behind Rome's pomp was a harlot. Today, do we discern the spirit of Babylon in worldly
                    culture or compromised religion? Also, consider the appeal of that "great city." Many were
                    enticed by Rome's power and luxury. We must heed Hebrews 13:14, "For here we have no
                    continuing city, but we seek the one to come." Our citizenship is in New Jerusalem, not Rome/
                    Babylon. The faithful in history often had to figuratively "come out of Rome/Babylon"
                    whether that meant leaving false churches or refusing imperial cults. We too may face times
                    where loyalty to Christ means distancing ourselves from "Babylonian" elements, even if they
                    appear as a powerful "great city" in Christendom. But we take courage: though Rome was
                    great, John sees her judged. Conversely, the Bride (New Jerusalem) in Revelation 21 is the
                    city that will truly reign forever under the King of kings. So as chapter 17 ends, a contrast is
                    implied: choose your city ‚Äì Babylon or New Jerusalem, the harlot or the bride. For us, the
                    choice is clear.
                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion & Spiritual Lessons</h3>
                <p>
                    Revelation 17, though filled with symbolism, conveys timeless lessons for
                    believers:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Peril of Apostasy: Babylon the harlot represents apostate religion - a warning that proximity
                        to truth (she had a golden cup and a pretense of wealth) can devolve into gross error if love for
                        Christ is abandoned. We must cling to pure doctrine and holy living, lest we partake in Babylon's
                        sins and plagues <sup>20 14</sup>. Personal holiness and devotion guard us from the seductions of spiritual
                        harlotry.</li>
                    <li>Come Out of Her: While chapter 18 explicitly calls, "Come out of her, My people" (Rev 18:4), already by
                        understanding chapter 17 we sense that application. God desires a separated people - in the world
                        but not of it. We should disentangle ourselves from compromising alliances, whether in religious,
                        moral, or philosophical matters. Is there any "Babylon" in our life - love of luxury, pride of position,
                        idolizing of anything alongside God? If so, flee from it.</li>
                    <li>God's Sovereignty Over History: Through all the frightening imagery - a blasphemous Beast, a
                        wealthy harlot, plotting kings - we see God's hand orchestrating events <sup>3</sup>. This comforts us that
                        nothing in our world surprises God. When we see corruption in high places or false teaching arising,
                        we know God already foresaw it and will judge it in His time. Our part is to remain faithful and
                        patient, bearing witness to the truth like the martyrs did, trusting that "the Judge of all the earth" will
                        do right.</li>
                    <li>The Victory of Christ: Evil may assemble its forces ("make war with the Lamb"), but the Lamb wins
                        <sup>51</sup>. Always. This fills us with hope and courage. No matter how strong the forces of anti-Christian
                        persecution or deception become, they are doomed to fail before our Savior. We therefore live not in
                        fear, but in expectation. We might well echo the early Christians: "Maranatha! Come, Lord Jesus." When
                        He comes, all Babylons fall and His Kingdom alone stands. Let us live even now under His lordship,
                        as citizens of the New Jerusalem, "called, chosen, and faithful" by His grace.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In summary, Revelation 17 has given us a rich prophetic panorama of false religion's apex and demise. It
                    has also given very practical warnings against spiritual infidelity and very precious assurances of Christ's
                    ultimate triumph. May we heed the warnings ‚Äì staying separate from Babylon ‚Äì and rejoice in the
                    assurances - staying with the Lamb who overcomes. As the next chapter will show the fall of Babylon in
                    detail, we already have the key takeaway: "Babylon the great is fallen" (Rev 18:2). But in contrast, "the
                    kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever" (Rev
                    11:15). Amen.
