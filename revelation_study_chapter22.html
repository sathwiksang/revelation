                <h3>Introduction and Context</h3>
                <p>
                    Revelation 22 is the final chapter of the Bible, completing the apocalyptic vision given to the Apostle John. It
                    continues the description of the New Jerusalem from chapter 21 and culminates with Christ's final promise
                    and a closing benediction. Notably, this last chapter brings Scripture full circle: the themes and images of
                    Revelation 22 intentionally echo those of Genesis 1-3 (the first chapters of the Bible) <sup>1</sup>. Here we see a
                    restoration of Paradise the river of life and the tree of life reappear, and the curse of sin is removed,
                    reversing the fall of man in Eden (cf. Genesis 2:9; 3:17-19). God's eternal plan of redemption is thus
                    completed, and the faithful enjoy unhindered fellowship with Him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This study will examine Revelation 22 verse by verse (using the NKJV text), drawing out doctrinal
                    significance and personal application. We will reference parallel Scriptures and insights from classic
                    conservative commentators including Plymouth Brethren authors known for their dispensational
                    theology and literal approach to prophecy. (The Plymouth Brethren movement, exemplified by writers like
                    John N. Darby and William Kelly, emphasizes the distinction between Israel and the Church in prophecy and
                    the imminence of Christ's return.) The goal is a very in-depth theological understanding of each verse,
                    coupled with practical lessons for personal spiritual growth.
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 22:1-5 - The River of Life and the Eternal Throne</h2>
                <p>
                    In the opening verses of this chapter, John's tour of the Holy City continues, focusing on the river of life,
                    the tree of life, and the blessings of God's throne in the midst of New Jerusalem. This section (22:1-5)
                    actually concludes the description of the city begun in Revelation 21. Some dispensational teachers note
                    that John may be describing the city's relationship to the millennial earth here, since nations are mentioned
                    (v.2) yet the same blessings also carry into the eternal state <sup>2</sup> <sup>3</sup>. Either way, the scene is one of
                    Paradise Restored.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 1: The Pure River of Water of Life</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God
                    and of the Lamb." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    John sees a river of the water of life flowing from God's throne at the center of the New Jerusalem. This
                    river, bright and clear as crystal, symbolizes the everlasting life and divine blessing that flow from God
                    and Christ (the Lamb) to His people. In Scripture, water often represents life, sustenance, and the Holy
                    Spirit's presence. Here it is called the "water of life", indicating it gives eternal life and full satisfaction to all
                    who drink freely (cf. Revelation 21:6). The psalmist similarly spoke of "a river whose streams shall make glad
                    the city of God" <sup>4</sup>. On earth, Jesus invited believers to partake of "living water" (the Holy Spirit) which
                    satisfies the thirsty soul (John 4:14, 7:37-39). In the heavenly city, this promise is seen in its consummated
                    form - an ever-flowing pure river from God's presence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This river "proceeds from the throne of God and of the Lamb." God's throne is the source of all life,
                    authority, and blessing in the eternal order. Importantly, God and the Lamb share the throne - a testimony to
                    the deity of Christ. The union of "God and the Lamb" on one throne is a recurring theme in John's vision <sup>5</sup>
                    underscoring that Jesus (the Lamb) reigns co-equally with the Father. For the believer, this speaks of the
                    security and abundance of life under Christ's reign. What flows to us from God's throne now is grace and
                    life, not judgment, because the Lamb has conquered sin.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theological Insight: William Kelly (a noted Plymouth Brethren commentator) observes that unlike the
                    thunders and judgments that once proceeded from God's throne (see Rev. 4:5 during the tribulation), now
                    "what issues from it? A river of water of life, bright as crystal", perfectly suited to the age of blessing
                    when Christ and the Church reign in glory <sup>6</sup>. The throne that once meant judgment for a rebellious world
                    now "is the source of blessing, not of curse", for God's servants (cf. John 7:38) <sup>7</sup>. This reflects how grace
                    characterizes the Church in glory even in reigning, the glorified saints are channels of life and healing,
                    not judgment <sup>8</sup>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: The "water of life" reminds us that even now, in this age, eternal life flows from Christ to us by
                    the Holy Spirit. Those who belong to Jesus have within them "a fountain of water springing up into
                    everlasting life" (John 4:14). We are invited to drink freely of His life. Just as physical water refreshes and
                    sustains, we should daily seek the refreshment of God's Spirit and Word. Ultimately, this verse gives hope
                    that all our spiritual thirst will be quenched in God's presence. Whenever you feel dry or weary, remember
                    that a river of life flows from God's throne approach Him in prayer and He will revive your soul (Psalm 46:4).
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 2: The Tree of Life and Healing for the Nations</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"In the middle of its street, and on either side of the river, was the tree of life, which bore twelve
                    fruits, each tree yielding its fruit every month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the
                    nations." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    John now notices the tree of life in the city. This imagery directly harkens back to the Garden of Eden - "the
                    tree of life" first appeared in Genesis 2:9 as a source of unending life for sinless man. After the Fall,
                    humanity was barred from that tree (Genesis 3:22-24), symbolizing the loss of eternal life and fellowship
                    with God. Now in the New Jerusalem, the way to the tree of life is open again through Christ's redemption.
                    The location is described somewhat mysteriously: the tree of life is in the middle of the city's street and on
                    either side of the river. This could imply multiple trees of life lining the river, or one vast tree with
                    interconnected roots/branches spanning the river. In either case, access to the tree of life is abundant for
                    all residents of the city.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The tree "bore twelve fruits, each yielding fruit every month." The number twelve in Scripture often signifies
                    human administration or completeness in God's government <sup>9</sup> <sup>10</sup>. Here, twelve fruits could indicate an all-
                    sufficient variety of provision. Unlike normal fruit trees which have one season of harvest, this tree is
                    ever-fruitful ("each month") - it never fails to provide nourishment. This symbolizes the continual, fresh
                    blessings of eternal life in God's presence. Believers in glory will forever be sustained and satisfied by
                    Christ, with no lapse in His life-giving provision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Not only fruit, but even "the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations." This intriguing
                    phrase suggests that the benefits of Christ's work (symbolized by the tree of life) extend to all peoples.
                    In the millennial age, the "nations" on earth will enjoy physical and spiritual healing under Christ's
                    reign, supplied in part through the New Jerusalem (which likely hovers over the earthly Jerusalem as a
                    heavenly city) <sup>11</sup> <sup>3</sup>. The imagery comes from the prophet Ezekiel's vision of a river flowing from the
                    future temple: "Along the bank of the river, on this side and that, will grow all kinds of trees used for food... their
                    fruit will be for food, and their leaves for medicine" (Ezekiel 47:12). John's vision builds on that, with the
                    ultimate fulfillment in the New Jerusalem. During Christ's 1000-year kingdom, the nations will still need
                    "healing" from the effects of past ages - and God will graciously supply it. The leaves may represent divine
                    truths or influences that bring moral and physical health to the world under Jesus' rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Kelly contrasts this grace-filled picture with the earthly Jerusalem's role in the millennium. Isaiah 60 says of
                    Zion: "The nation which will not serve you shall perish" - indicating strict justice on rebel nations. But the
                    heavenly Jerusalem (the Church in glory) operates on grace: "the leaves...for healing" show mercy and
                    blessing flowing outward <sup>12</sup> <sup>6</sup>. "Pure grace reigning through righteousness" is the character of the scene
                    <sup>13</sup>. God's kingdom will uplift the world by grace, even as His justice also reigns. We see here a beautiful
                    picture of the Church's ministry in the ages to come not only enjoying God's life internally (fruits), but
                    also channeling healing to others (leaves), all under Christ's lordship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: The tree of life represents Christ Himself as the source of all eternal blessings - He is "the true
                    Vine" in whom we abide for life (John 15:5). The endless fruitfulness of this tree reminds us that in Jesus
                    there is always fresh grace for every need, "new every morning" (Lamentations 3:22-23). There is a "fruit"
                    for each "month" - meaning God has provision for every season of our lives. We need never go spiritually
                    hungry if we stay near Christ. Additionally, the "healing leaves" challenge us that even now, as the Church,
                    we are called to extend God's healing grace to the "nations" - to a hurting world. We possess the words of
                    life (the Gospel) which bring healing to sin-sick souls. How eagerly do we offer the hope and restoration
                    found in Jesus to those around us? Let's be "leaf-bearers" even in this age, ministering God's grace and
                    pointing people to the tree of life - Jesus Christ.

                <h3>Verse 3: No More Curse - Serving God on His Throne</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His
                    servants shall serve Him." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is one of the most joyous proclamations of the eternal state: "No more curse." Ever since Adam's fall,
                    creation has labored under the curse of sin and death (Genesis 3:14-19). Pain, thorns, sorrow, and
                    separation from God have been humanity's lot. But in the New Jerusalem, because "there is no more sin",
                    every vestige of the curse is gone <sup>14</sup>. All the "bondage of corruption" will be banished, and the universe
                    enters the glorious liberty of God's children (Romans 8:21). Every result of the fall is erased - no more death,
                    suffering, decay, or judgment (cf. Revelation 21:4). Christ has fully redeemed creation, and this is the
                    tangible fulfillment of Galatians 3:13, "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse
                    for us." We now experience some freedom from the curse spiritually, but then it will be a complete, cosmic
                    lift of the curse - an environment of total blessing and life. (It's noteworthy that the Old Testament ends
                    with the word "curse" in Malachi 4:6, whereas the New Testament ends with God's grace <sup>15</sup> <sup>16</sup>.
                    Through Jesus, the curse is replaced by blessing!)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Instead of a curse, we see a throne: "the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it." God's throne denotes
                    His sovereign presence and kingly rule. In the eternal order, God is not distant; He is enthroned right in
                    the midst of His people (Revelation 21:3). This fulfills the promise of Ezekiel 48:35, "The name of the city
                    from that day shall be: THE LORD IS THERE." There is no more separation between God and redeemed
                    mankind. "God and the Lamb" sharing the throne emphasizes again Christ's deity and the unity of the
                    Father and Son in the kingdom (John 10:30). It also reflects how Jesus' mediatorial kingdom (as Messiah on
                    David's throne) is now merged into the eternal kingdom of God <sup>17</sup> <sup>18</sup> one throne over all forever. The
                    Davidic throne (for Israel) and the Father's throne become one, with Christ reigning in perfect union with
                    the Father for eternity (see 1 Corinthians 15:24-28). For us, this means we will live continually under the
                    loving lordship of God - the best and safest place to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "And His servants shall serve Him." What a privilege in eternity, we are not idle; we joyfully serve God
                    forever. The word for "serve" here (Greek latreu≈ç) often implies worshipful service <sup>19</sup>. Our service will be
                    pure worship, not drudgery. In Eden, Adam was given work to tend the garden before sin (Genesis 2:15);
                    Likewise, work itself is not a curse - toil and futility are (Genesis 3:17-19). In the New Jerusalem, our service is
                    meaningful and delightful, free from frustration. What will this service entail? Possibly reigning with
                    Christ over the universe (as suggested by verse 5) and priestly worship (we'll be "priests of God"
                    Revelation 20:6). We may have assignments in God's eternal administration, exploring His infinite wisdom
                    and carrying out His will across the ages. The key point is that heaven is not inactivity; it is productive, God-
                    glorifying activity. "They shall serve Him" implies intimacy and purpose we serve in His immediate
                    presence, seeing our Lord's delight as we do His will. Indeed, "His servants shall serve Him" can also be
                    translated "shall worship Him". Our perfect service is perfect worship every act an act of love and
                    devotion. What an honor that God invites us to serve Him eternally, indicating He has fulfilling roles for us in
                    His kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Do you view heaven as merely a place of rest, or also a place of service? Verse 3 assures us our
                    deepest fulfillment will be found in serving our King. If service is worship in eternity, it should be so now
                    as well. "Serve the Lord with gladness" (Psalm 100:2) - even now, our work for Christ can be joyful when done
                    for His glory. Knowing we'll serve Him eternally encourages us to serve Him wholeheartedly here on
                    earth. Every act of obedience or ministry now is a foretaste of the eternal purpose God created us for. Also,
                    the removal of the curse means nothing will hinder our work no fatigue, no frustration. If you ever feel
                    your labor in the Lord is in vain, remember that in eternity "his servants shall serve Him" in utter
                    fruitfulness. This motivates us to be faithful servants today, looking forward to our reward of serving Him
                    unhindered in glory (1 Corinthians 15:58).
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 4: Beholding God's Face and Bearing His Name</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"They shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This simple verse contains two profound privileges promised to God's people:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>"They shall see His face." - This is staggering! In our current mortal state, no one can literally see
                        God's face (His full glory) and live (Exodus 33:20). Sinful man has been estranged from direct vision of
                        God since the fall. Even Moses only saw God's back, and Isaiah, upon seeing a vision of God's glory,
                        cried out in terror (Isaiah 6:5). But in the New Jerusalem, the redeemed will finally behold God face to
                        face. Unbroken fellowship and intimate knowledge of God is the essence of eternal life (John
                        17:3). This fulfills Jesus' promise, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God" (Matthew 5:8),
                        and the longing of all the faithful. In the resurrection, we will be made perfectly holy and immortal,
                        able to endure the blazing beauty of God's presence. "We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He
                        is" (1 John 3:2). The beatific vision - seeing God is the greatest reward of heaven. Throughout
                        Scripture, the highest hope is for God's face to shine upon His people (Numbers 6:25, Psalm 17:15).
                        Here that hope is realized forever. "They shall see His face" indicates complete acceptance (we are no
                        longer separated by sin) and complete revelation (we will truly know God). Paul said now we see in a
                        mirror dimly, "but then face to face" (1 Corinthians 13:12). Imagine, face to face with the Lord - gazing
                        on His glory, experiencing His love directly, nothing between us and Him! That is the heaven of
                        heavens. William Kelly exclaims that this vision of God will be the portion of "the pure in heart",
                        who finally see what they longed for <sup>20</sup>. Personal communion with God will be unhindered and
                        constant.</li>
                    <li>"His name shall be on their foreheads." - In Revelation, having a name on the forehead signifies
                        ownership and identification. Earlier, God sealed His servants on their foreheads (Revelation 7:3), and
                        the 144,000 had "His Father's name written on their foreheads" (Revelation 14:1). In the letter to
                        Philadelphia, Jesus promised the overcomer, "I will write on him the name of My God... and My new
                        name" (Revelation 3:12). Now, collectively, all God's servants bear His name on their foreheads. This
                        means we openly belong to Him and reflect His character. The forehead is a prominent, visible place
                        our identity as God's own people will be perfectly evident. No more do we carry the name of sin or
                        the beast or anything corrupt; we bear God's holy name as a mark of highest honor. This likely
                        fulfills Scriptures like Isaiah 43:7, where God says His people are "created for My glory; I have formed
                        them... I have made them" and called by His name. In ancient times, slaves or soldiers would
                        sometimes be branded with their master's or patron's name - here God Himself "brands" us as His
                        very own (in love, not coercion). Eternally, we will never forget whose we are we are God's
                        treasured possession. And perhaps others will "see" God's name on us and thereby see the glory of
                        God in us. In other words, we will perfectly manifest God's character (bearing His name implies
                        reflecting His holiness and love). What a contrast to the mark of the beast on the foreheads of the
                        damned (Revelation 13:16-17)! The faithful chose God's name, and now they shine with it.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    These two blessings together - seeing God's face and bearing His name speak of intimate fellowship
                    and identification with God. We will truly know Him and truly be His. This is the culmination of the biblical
                    covenant promise: "I will be their God, and they shall be My people" (Jeremiah 31:33). We belong to Him and
                    behold Him. Theologians call this glorification - we are glorified in His presence, and He is glorified in us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Meditating on "seeing His face" should fill us with hope and purity. 1 John 3:2-3 says that
                    since we hope to see Him as He is, "everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure." The
                    prospect of unfiltered communion with God should motivate us to seek a closer walk with Him now - to
                    "seek His face" in prayer and worship (Psalm 27:4,8). Though we see dimly now, we can still gaze upon the
                    glory of the Lord in Scripture and be transformed (2 Corinthians 3:18). Also, knowing God's name is on us
                    even now (we bear the name "Christian") encourages us to live in a manner worthy of that Name. We are
                    representatives of Christ; our thoughts and actions are like having His name on our foreheads for the world
                    to read. Let's not bring reproach to that name. Instead, let's show we belong to Jesus by our love and
                    holiness. Ultimately, the promise of forever seeing God's face is a strong antidote to discouragement - one
                    day all spiritual dryness will vanish when our faith turns to sight. As the hymn says, "And Lord, haste the day
                    when my faith shall be sight!" - we long for that day.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 5: Eternal Light and Reign</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"There shall be no night there: They need no lamp nor light of the sun, for the Lord God gives them
                    light. And they shall reign forever and ever." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reiterating what was said of New Jerusalem in Revelation 21:23-25, John emphasizes that in the city it is
                    never night. "No night" implies not only the absence of literal darkness, but the absence of all that
                    darkness symbolically represents: no ignorance, no fear, no evil lurking nothing hidden or troubling.
                    Nighttime, with its dangers and uncertainties, simply doesn't exist in God's perfected kingdom. The verse
                    explains why: "They need no lamp nor sunlight, for the Lord God gives them light." The direct glory of God is the
                    light source of the New Jerusalem (cf. Isaiah 60:19-20). There is perpetual, perfect illumination. Imagine a
                    world where you don't need candles, electricity, or the sun itself to see - God's radiant presence lights up
                    everything! This speaks to the glory of God permeating every aspect of life there. His Shekinah glory that
                    once lit the Holy of Holies now lights the entire city continuously. In human history, darkness has also been
                    tied to sorrow and uncertainty; by contrast, "God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all" (1 John 1:5). In
                    eternity, we live fully in God's light intellectually and morally as well. All questions answered, all truth
                    revealed, all beauty visible. This fulfills Old Testament prophecies: "The LORD will be to you an everlasting
                    light, and your God your glory" <sup>21</sup>. "Your sun shall no longer go down... for the LORD will be your everlasting
                    light" (Isaiah 60:19-20). Our days of walking by faith in a dark world will be over; we will literally walk by
                    sight in God's light.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, we read: "And they shall reign forever and ever." Earlier in Revelation it was said that the saints
                    would reign with Christ for 1000 years (Rev. 20:4-6). But here the promise is unending: not only for a
                    millennium, but "to the ages of ages", forever. The reign of God's people is eternal. What does it mean that
                    we shall reign? It fulfills verses like Daniel 7:27, "Then the kingdom... shall be given to the people, the saints of
                    the Most High; His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom...", and Christ's words that the faithful would rule over
                    "many things" (Matthew 25:21) and sit with Him on His throne (Revelation 3:21). In some amazing way, God
                    invites the redeemed to share in Christ's kingly authority over the new creation. We are made "kings and
                    priests" (Revelation 1:6, 5:10) - a royal family under the Great King. Throughout eternity, there will be roles
                    of responsibility and governance for God's glory. Perhaps over galaxies or new worlds the Lord will create in
                    the infinite future we don't know, but "of the increase of His government... there will be no end" (Isaiah
                    9:7). Note, however, our reign is derivative: it flows from God's throne (which is why this statement comes
                    immediately after mentioning God's light). We reign under God, by His light and glory, not independently.

                <p>
                    Kelly explains that reigning "to the ages of the ages" must be taken in the absolute sense here - "beyond
                    the thousand years" into all eternity <sup>22</sup> <sup>23</sup>. During the Millennium, the glorified saints reign with Christ over
                    the earth. After the final judgment, when the form of the kingdom changes (Christ delivers the kingdom to
                    the Father per 1 Cor. 15:24), the sphere of our reigning may shift from the millennial earth to the wider new
                    creation. But in essence, the saints continue to share Christ's reign forever <sup>24</sup>. Our service (v.3) and
                    reigning (v.5) both persist eternally, though the context changes once sin and death are no more. Thus,
                    heaven is not a static condition - it includes an active, regal destiny for God's people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: "They shall reign forever" underlines the astonishing grace and exaltation God gives His
                    children. We who were once slaves to sin are not only freed and forgiven, but enthroned with Christ! This
                    speaks of our identity and hope. Are we living like people destined for a throne? That doesn't mean
                    arrogance - it means confidence in our Lord's victory and our inheritance in Him. Paul wrote, "If we endure,
                    we shall also reign with Him" (2 Timothy 2:12). Endurance in trials now is easier when we remember the
                    honor and authority Christ will share with us soon. Also, knowing we will reign forever encourages us that
                    our relationship with Christ is eternal and secure we are forever part of His royal household. Unlike
                    earthly positions that fade, our role in God's kingdom will never end. So we should serve faithfully now,
                    even in small things, as training for greater service in eternity (Luke 19:17). Furthermore, "no night" and
                    God's perpetual light mean that even in our darkest nights now, we can look forward to a time when all
                    darkness flees away. "The night is far spent, the day is is at hand" (Romans 13:12). Let that hope brighten your
                    perspective when you walk through dark valleys here. The Lord will be your everlasting light.

                    Verses 1-5 have given us a breathtaking glimpse of the eternal blessings awaiting believers: abundant life,
                    healing, intimate fellowship with God, and exaltation to reign with Christ. Truly, as 1 Corinthians 2:9 says, "Eye has
                    not seen, nor ear heard... the things which God has prepared for those who love Him." Now the chapter (and the
                    book) transitions from description to final exhortations and promises:
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 22:6-11 - Faithful Words, Imminent Return, and Exhortations</h2>
                <p>
                    Beginning in verse 6, the angel and Jesus Himself speak to John, affirming the trustworthiness of this
                    revelation and emphasizing the nearness of the Lord's coming. John is reminded to obey and share this
                    prophecy (not seal it up), and there is a solemn indication that when the end comes, a person's fate is fixed.
                    This section serves as a "divine epilogue" <sup>25</sup> to the entire book of Revelation, highlighting key takeaways for
                    the reader.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 6: "These Words Are Faithful and True"</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"Then he said to me, 'These words are faithful and true.' And the Lord God of the holy prophets sent
                    His angel to show His servants the things which must shortly take place." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The angel who has been guiding John (one of the seven bowl angels, cf. Rev 21:9) now assures him that
                    everything he has heard and seen is trustworthy. "These words are faithful and true" echoes a similar declaration
                    from Revelation 21:5 <sup>26</sup>. In other words, the prophecies and promises just described (and indeed the
                    whole book) are completely reliable because they come from God who cannot lie. Believers reading this
                    prophecy can be confident that the glorious future of Revelation 21-22 will surely come to pass, and that
                    the warnings of judgment will also be fulfilled. This is important because Revelation contains many
                    astounding, even hard-to-imagine scenes; the angel affirms their veracity. The phrase "faithful and true"
                    also recalls one of Christ's titles (Revelation 19:11 He is "Faithful and True"). Ultimately, Jesus is the
                    guarantee of these words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Next, "the Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must shortly take
                    place." This reminds us of how the book began: Revelation 1:1 says God "sent and signified [these things] by
                    His angel to His servant John." Here God is called the "Lord God of the holy prophets." This title emphasizes
                    continuity with all previous biblical prophecy. The same God who inspired Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, etc., has
                    now given this revelation. He is faithful to His promises. Just as their prophecies came true, so will John's.
                    God is the Lord of history who spoke through the prophets and now speaks through this vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The content of the revelation is described as "the things which must shortly take place." This also echoes
                    Revelation 1:1 ("things which must shortly come to pass"). It underscores the imminence of these events.
                    From God's perspective, the unfolding of end-times events is near - not necessarily meaning "immediately"
                    in human reckoning, but that they are the next major step in His redemptive plan and can begin at any
                    time. The word "must" shows divine necessity - these events are decreed by God's sovereign will (compare
                    the prophetic "must" in Luke 24:44). For the original readers (first-century churches) and us today, "shortly"
                    is meant to impart a sense of urgency and expectation. In God's timing, the return of Christ and
                    consummation of all things is always at hand (Romans 13:11-12).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theological Note: John Darby pointed out that the Church is always to consider the time at hand, unlike
                    Daniel who was told his prophecy was for "many days to come." To Daniel, God said, "seal the book until the
                    time of the end" (Dan. 12:4); but to John, "Do not seal... for the time is at hand" <sup>27</sup>. The Church has no date
                    schedule to tick off we live in the last days since Christ's first coming (Hebrews 1:2). Darby wrote that the
                    assembly is viewed as outside of prophetic time-counting; our attitude is to be one of constant readiness
                    <sup>28</sup> <sup>29</sup>. Thus "shortly" doesn't set a specific deadline by human calendars, but keeps believers in every
                    generation watchful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Do we treat God's Word - especially prophetic Scripture - as "faithful and true"? In a skeptical age,
                    we must hold fast to the trustworthiness of these promises. Prophecies about Christ's first coming were
                    fulfilled literally; those about His second coming will be just as certain. Let this assurance strengthen your
                    faith. Also, the phrase "must shortly take place" challenges us to live in a state of readiness. Jesus is
                    coming again, and the events of Revelation will happen. We shouldn't become complacent, assuming
                    "my master delays His coming." Instead, maintain a sense of urgency in holy living and in sharing the
                    Gospel. As 2 Peter 3:11 says, "Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought
                    you to be in holy conduct and godliness!" God gave us prophecy not to satisfy curiosity but to sanctify us and
                    spur us to mission. Because the time is near, we should redeem the time (Ephesians 5:16) - obey God now,
                    serve Him now, reach others now.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 7: "Behold, I Am Coming Quickly - Blessed is He Who Keeps the Words"</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Suddenly, Jesus Himself interjects with a dramatic declaration (the switch to first person "I" indicates Christ
                    speaking). He says: "Behold, I am coming quickly!" This is the first of three times in this closing section that
                    Christ affirms His imminent return (see also verses 12 and 20) <sup>30</sup>. The repetition underscores how strongly
                    Jesus wants us to live in expectation of His swift, sudden coming. "Quickly" (Greek tachu) can mean soon or
                    suddenly/unexpectedly. Given that nearly 2,000 years have passed, the emphasis is likely on the suddenness
                    when the time comes, it will be in a moment, without delay (1 Corinthians 15:52). Also, from the divine
                    perspective, time is short (2 Peter 3:8). The key is that Jesus wants every generation to heed this promise: I
                    am coming! He is alive and will personally return to consummate history. For believers, this is a joyful hope;
                    for the world, a warning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jesus prefacing it with "Behold" means "Pay attention!" It's as if He waves to get our attention: Listen, I'm
                    coming soon! The certainty of Christ's return is meant to be central in our consciousness. The early church
                    kept this hope bright, often greeting one another with "Maranatha" ("O Lord, come!", 1 Cor. 16:22). We too
                    should frequently recall and rejoice in our Lord's promised return.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the announcement, Jesus pronounces the final of Revelation's seven beatitudes: "Blessed is he who
                    keeps the words of the prophecy of this book." (Compare the first beatitude in Rev. 1:3: "Blessed is he who
                    reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written in it.") The book of
                    Revelation begins and ends with this double blessing on those who heed its message <sup>25</sup>. To "keep" means
                    to observe, guard, or obey. It's not enough to read or study prophecy; we are called to respond to it with
                    faithful obedience and vigilance. Despite its mysteries, Revelation was given for practical impact to shape
                    how we live and persevere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What does "keeping the words" look like? It includes holding fast the truths revealed (e.g. believing in
                    Christ's ultimate victory, the reality of judgment, etc.), obeying the commands/exhortations given (such as
                    "repent" in the letters to churches, or "come out of Babylon" in Rev. 18:4), and maintaining watchfulness
                    for Christ's return. It's developing the perspective and hope Revelation instills - living a holy life "set apart"
                    from the world, zealously resisting evil (like the beastly systems), enduring trials with the vision of the
                    Lamb's triumph in mind. Jesus promises that such a person is "blessed" - meaning favored and happy in
                    God's sight. Indeed, great joy comes from aligning our lives with God's prophetic word. We experience
                    peace amid chaos because we keep the certainty of God's plan in view. Also, we'll be blessed in the age to
                    come - possibly receiving reward for honoring and obeying this book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historical Insight: H.A. Ironside commented on the significance of Revelation's beginning and ending with
                    a blessing: "Significantly, the book of Revelation begins and ends with a blessing pronounced on those who read
                    and keep what is written therein (1:3; 22:7)" <sup>31</sup>. This was perhaps to encourage Christians not to neglect this
                    prophetic book. Sadly, through history some have ignored Revelation or thought it too hard; but Jesus
                    himself emphasizes our responsibility to read and heed it. William Kelly even noted how some church
                    liturgies practically left Revelation out, and he saw verse 7 as Christ's preventive warning against such
                    neglect <sup>32</sup>. We are accountable for the book of Revelation as much as any Scripture.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We should ask ourselves: Am I "keeping" the words of Revelation? It might help to list some key
                    takeaways we've learned: e.g., God is sovereign over history; Jesus is the worthy Lamb who will rule; Satan's
                    kingdoms will fall; Jesus could return at any moment; there is a heavenly home awaiting, etc. Do we live in
                    light of these truths? To keep this prophecy is to let it purify our priorities for instance, knowing
                    Babylon's materialistic system will be judged (Rev. 18) should cause us to hold possessions loosely and seek
                    first God's kingdom. Knowing trials are temporary and glory is ahead helps us endure suffering without
                    compromising. Keeping Revelation's words might also mean encouraging others with its hope or warning
                    others of its judgments essentially, treating it as real and life-changing. Jesus says such a person is
                    blessed. If we find obedience hard, remember that God never commands without also offering blessing. The
                    way of ultimate joy is to take His Word seriously. So let's treasure the prophecies in this book, not as
                    fanciful stories, but as future certainties that demand a response. Every "blessed" in Scripture invites us into
                    a deeper joy through trust and obedience.
                </p>

                <h3>Verses 8-9: John's Worship Mistake and Angelic Correction</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"Now I, John, saw and heard these things. And when I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the
                    feet of the angel who showed me these things. Then he said to me, 'See that you do not do that. For I
                    am your fellow servant, and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this
                    book. Worship God." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Apostle John now inserts a personal testimony (identifying himself by name, as also in 1:9).
                    Overwhelmed by all the visions ("these things") he has witnessed, John falls down to worship at the feet of
                    the angel who has been his guide. This mirrors an earlier incident in Revelation 19:10 where John did the
                    same and was rebuked. Despite having walked with Jesus and receiving so much truth, John - in the rapture
                    of this moment - momentarily errs by directing worship to the glorious angel. It's a reminder that even the
                    holiest of humans can falter and that the splendor of angelic beings is powerful but must not distract us
                    from God. Perhaps John was emotionally overcome and instinctively showed reverence to the messenger.
                    But worship is reserved for God alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The angel responds firmly: "See that you do not do that" (or "Do not do that!"). He immediately stops John.
                    "For I am your fellow servant (slave), and of your brethren the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this
                    book. Worship God." This is a crucial correction: angels, though magnificent, are created beings and fellow
                    servants of God along with humans. The angel identifies himself as a "fellow servant" (Greek sundoulos - co-
                    slave) of three groups: John (and by extension believers), the prophets, and those who keep these words (all
                    obedient Christians). In other words, the angel is saying, "I'm on the same team as you! I serve God like you
                    do. I may have a different role, but I'm not your Lord." Angels are servants of God who minister to the saints
                    (Hebrews 1:14). They are not to be worshiped or prayed to. This verse strongly refutes any idea of angel-
                    worship or veneration - a practice the New Testament warns against (Colossians 2:18). Even the prophets
                    (who delivered God's Word) were just servants, not to be idolized.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only God is worthy of worship. The angel's final command is the core of all Scripture: "Worship God." This
                    echoes the first commandment and Jesus' words to Satan, "You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only
                    you shall serve" (Matthew 4:10). It's notable that earlier in Revelation, on two occasions, heavenly beings and
                    elders do receive worship without rebuking it but those beings were the Lamb (Jesus) in Revelation 5:14
                    and God on the throne in 4:10. Here the angel deflects worship to God <sup>33</sup>, which incidentally shows that
                    Jesus is indeed God, because He does accept worship (Revelation 5:8-14, and throughout the Gospels).
                </p>
                <p>
                    John's mistake and the correction are recorded twice (here and 19:10) - likely to emphasize humility and the
                    supreme glory of God over even the highest creatures. If John, an apostle, could momentarily slip, we too
                    must be careful to direct our devotion properly. Even good things (like messengers, pastors, saints) must
                    not take God's place in our hearts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: The angel's words "I am your fellow servant" teach us the true attitude of God's servants
                    whether angelic or human which is to point away from themselves to God. This is a model for Christian
                    ministry: we should never allow undue adulation of us; instead, deflect all glory to God. If an apostle must
                    not be worshiped, neither should any church leader be elevated to god-like status. Also, we learn to discern
                    spiritual experiences. Not every awe-inspiring experience is meant to lead us to venerate the instrument
                    through which it comes. John was overwhelmed by the experience, but the angel essentially says: "Stay
                    theologically grounded, John. Only God gets worship." In our lives, we might be tempted to "adore" the means
                    of a blessing (like a preacher, a worship band, an angelic encounter if one ever happened) - but we must
                    always give the glory to God. Keep "Worship God" as a motto.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, this incident beautifully shows an angel's humility and unity with us. It's comforting to know that
                    these mighty angels consider themselves comrades with us who serve God and keep His Word. We are part
                    of a vast family of servants - prophets of old, apostles, angels, and us today all on one mission to honor
                    God. So when you worship God, you join a cosmic chorus. Let nothing and no one else take that worship. If
                    John needed a second reminder, how much more do we need to guard our hearts from idolatry in subtle
                    forms. Worship God alone.

                <h3>Verse 10: Do Not Seal the Prophecy - The Time is at Hand</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And he said to me, 'Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is at hand."" (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The angel (or possibly Jesus - but likely still the angel, continuing his instructions) now tells John that this
                    book of prophecy is to be left open and unsealed. In ancient times, to "seal" a scroll meant to roll it up and
                    secure it closed, often to hide its contents until a later time. John is explicitly commanded not to seal the
                    book. This is in contrast to the Old Testament prophet Daniel, who was told, "seal up the vision... for many
                    days in the future" (Daniel 8:26) and "seal the book until the time of the end" (Daniel 12:4,9) <sup>34</sup>. Daniel's
                    prophecies had a long-term fulfillment primarily involving Israel's distant future; thus, they were "sealed" in
                    the sense that their full understanding would await the end times. But John's prophecy, dealing largely with
                    the end times and the Church's hope, is to be unsealed immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Do not seal" implies that the message is meant to be read, heard, and understood now. God wants His
                    people of every generation to have access to the truths in Revelation. The early church was to study it and
                    take it to heart (as we saw in verse 7). There is an urgency to Revelation's message - hence it must not be
                    hidden away or treated as an esoteric secret. Sadly, many through history neglected this book or treated it
                    as sealed due to its symbolism, but the angel's instruction shows God's intention for clarity and
                    dissemination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason given is: "for the time is at hand." Similar to verse 6's "shortly take place," this reinforces the
                    imminence of the events described. "At hand" means near. In God's redemptive timeline, nothing else
                    needs to happen before these end-time events can begin. The coming of Christ and the consummation of
                    the age are impending. Therefore, believers must have these prophecies unsealed and in view, so they can
                    live accordingly. If the time was "at hand" in the first century, how much more now! This phrase "the time is
                    at hand" brackets the book along with Revelation 1:3 ("the time is near"). In essence, Revelation begins with
                    "the time is near" and ends with "the time is at hand." The idea is that with Christ's first coming, death
                    and resurrection, the last days have arrived (Hebrews 1:2), and the next big event is His return. We live
                    on the brink of eternity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    John Darby explains this by noting that now that Christ has come and accomplished redemption, time from
                    the church's perspective is always viewed as short - "To the Christian the end is always near... the Church is
                    heavenly, and in heaven are no times or seasons" <sup>35</sup>. In other words, the church exists in a state of
                    expectancy, not tied to a timeline of earthly events as Israel was. Darby contrasted how Daniel was told to
                    seal his book because there was a sequence of epochs for Israel to pass through, but John's is unsealed
                    because the Church could be taken home at any moment <sup>35</sup>. The prophetic lamp is to be kept burning and
                    visible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: We should be thankful that Revelation is "unsealed." God wants us to know His plans. This
                    should motivate us to study and proclaim this book. It's not to be treated as an encrypted code for scholars
                    only; it's for all "His servants" (1:1). Don't shy away from Revelation - God intentionally made it available and
                    understandable (with the Spirit's help) because the time is near. Also, knowing the time is at hand, we should
                    cultivate an attitude of readiness and watchfulness. This doesn't mean trying to set dates (Matthew 24:36
                    forbids that), but it means living morally and spiritually awake. Jesus said, "Blessed is that servant whom his
                    master finds watching" (Luke 12:37). We should have a sense of destiny about our lives that at any time
                    our Lord might call us to Himself or begin to wrap up history. That urgency can translate into zeal for
                    evangelism (since time for the lost may be short) and diligence in personal holiness (since we want to be
                    found faithful).
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a practical level, "do not seal" could also apply to how we handle God's Word. We shouldn't "seal" it by
                    keeping it to ourselves or neglecting it. Let's open the book of Revelation (and all Scripture) regularly, and
                    also help others understand it. There is a blessing in making God's truth known. The angel basically
                    authorized John to publish Revelation widely; likewise, we are authorized to share its message: Jesus is
                    coming soon; the kingdom is near; repent and believe! The unsealed book is meant to produce an unsealed
                    life open, transparent, and expectant before God.

                <h3>Verse 11: Final States - Righteous or Filthy Still</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"He who is unjust, let him be unjust still; he who is filthy, let him be filthy still; he who is righteous, let
                    him be righteous still; he who is holy, let him be holy still." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This verse is a solemn and somewhat startling pronouncement. It is not a command to be unjust or holy;
                    rather, it's declaring a reality about the finality of one's moral state when the end comes. In context, because
                    "the time is at hand" (v.10), there will come a point when time runs out for change. Essentially, when Christ
                    returns and the final judgment arrives, a person's character is fixed eternally. The verse reads like a
                    pronouncement of destiny: the unjust (unrepentant) will remain unjust forever; the filthy (morally defiled)
                    will remain filthy forever. Conversely, the righteous will remain righteous, and the holy will remain holy
                    forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can be understood as God's decree of finality. When Jesus comes and closes this age, "he who is unjust
                    (or does wrong) must remain so still" - there will be no further opportunity to repent and be made righteous.
                    The day of grace will be over for the sinner. Similarly, those who have been cleansed and made holy will
                    remain holy for eternity never again falling into sin. This has a parallel in Daniel 12:10, "Many shall be
                    purified and made white... but the wicked shall do wickedly; and none of the wicked shall understand." In that
                    sense, in the end times, the wicked persist in wickedness despite warnings, and the righteous continue in
                    righteousness by God's grace. But Revelation 22:11 extends it to an eternal principle: as death finds you, so
                    judgment keeps you. It's reminiscent of Jesus' parable of the ten virgins (Matthew 25:1-13) where the door
                    was shut on the foolish virgins - too late to remedy their lack of oil.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Steve Ironside (paraphrasing) noted that "as a man is found in that coming day, so he will remain for all
                    eternity" <sup>36</sup>. The statement "let him be still" indicates a continuing state. This is actually sobering: It's
                    implying now is the time to be made righteous (through Christ) or else a day is coming when change is no
                    longer possible. The unjust and filthy describe the lost in terms of their wrongdoing and impurity of heart.
                    The righteous and holy describe the saved, whose lives have been justified by faith and sanctified by God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One might wonder why a statement like this is given here. It serves as an emphatic warning and
                    encouragement at the end of the book. It's as if God is saying: "If these words don't persuade you to repent,
                    then there's nothing more I can say go on in your wickedness if you will. But know that judgment is coming
                    quickly and will freeze you in that state." God allows people the freedom to choose; if they stubbornly choose
                    unrighteousness, He confirms them in that choice at judgment (like Pharaoh hardening his heart and then
                    God hardening it). On the flip side, it's an encouragement to the believer: if you are striving to be righteous
                    and holy now, continue - remain faithful, because your righteous standing will be eternally vindicated and
                    secure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to note: This verse is descriptive, not prescriptive. God is not advising people to stay unjust; He
                    is foretelling that many will, despite warnings. It carries a tone of lament and finality, much like Jesus
                    saying, "Let the dead bury their own dead" (Luke 9:60) i.e., those who are spiritually dead will act
                    accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: The implication for us today is to urgently choose righteousness while we still can. "Behold,
                    now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation" (2 Corinthians 6:2). We do not want to be found
                    in the filthy/unjust category when Jesus comes or when we die. How do we ensure we're in the "righteous/
                    holy" category? By receiving Christ's righteousness by faith (justification) and pursuing a holy life in the
                    power of the Spirit (sanctification). Once we have that new standing, verse 11 encourages us: keep living it
                    out ("let the righteous still do right, let the holy still be holy"). Don't lapse back. Persevere in godliness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the unbeliever or procrastinator, verse 11 is a wake-up call: there is a point of no return. After death or
                    when Christ returns, your character and destiny are sealed. There will be no last-minute character changes
                    at the Great White Throne. Today, however, transformation is possible filthy souls can be washed, unjust
                    hearts can be justified - through the blood of Jesus (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). So, choose this day whom you will
                    serve (Joshua 24:15).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even for believers, there is a caution: Don't flirt with sin, thinking, "I'll repent later." That can harden into a
                    permanent state. Instead, "keep yourselves in the love of God" (Jude 21). Continue in holiness; every day we
                    practice righteousness is a day we are being who we will be forever. There's also comfort in knowing that if
                    we are declared righteous in Christ, in eternity we will forever be righteous (no more struggle with sin
                    nature hallelujah!). Conversely, those who love evil now and refuse Christ will be stuck with their sinful
                    nature forever, which is a hell in itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, verse 11 draws a sharp line and calls us to live on the right side of that line while we have time. It's
                    one more motivator to heed the gospel presented implicitly throughout Revelation (the Lamb's offer of
                    salvation) - because the Lamb is returning, and then "Let him who is filthy be filthy still." Don't let that be said
                    of you rather, "he who is holy, let him be holy still."
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 22:12-17 - Jesus' Final Declarations and the Grand Invitation</h2>
                <p>
                    In these verses, Jesus speaks again (verses 12-16), affirming His imminent coming and identifying Himself
                    by majestic titles. We also find one of the most beautiful invitations in Scripture (verse 17), where the Holy
                    Spirit and the Church jointly call people to come to Christ for salvation. This section blends doctrinal truth
                    about Christ's person and work with a tender gospel appeal, all in light of His soon return.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 12: "I Am Coming Quickly, and My Reward Is with Me"</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And behold, I am coming quickly, and My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his
                    work." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once more, Jesus proclaims: "Behold, I am coming quickly." The word "behold" signals something
                    important - Jesus wants our full attention on this promise. We've now heard "I am coming quickly" from His
                    lips in verse 7 and here, and we will hear it once more in verse 20. This triple affirmation cements the
                    certainty and urgency of His return. We should never doubt whether Christ will come or become lax about
                    when - He says it will be sudden and without delay when the appointed time arrives.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here Jesus adds that when He comes, "My reward is with Me, to give to every one according to his
                    work." This echoes Isaiah 40:10 and 62:11, which prophesied of God's coming with reward and recompense
                    <sup>17</sup>. It portrays Jesus as the divine Judge and Rewarder. He carries "wages" or "rewards" with Him
                    meaning He is ready to distribute the outcomes of judgment. For believers, reward often implies positive
                    reward (crowns, commendation, etc., as per 2 Timothy 4:8, 1 Corinthians 3:14). For unbelievers, the "reward"
                    of their works is punishment (Rom. 6:23 says the wages of sin is death). In Revelation 11:18, it was said the
                    time had come to "reward Your servants the prophets and the saints... and to destroy those who destroy the
                    earth." So both recompense for the righteous and retribution for the wicked are in view.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "To give to every one according to his work" establishes the biblical principle of judgment according to
                    deeds. While we are saved by grace through faith (Ephesians 2:8-9), our works are the evidence of our faith
                    and will be evaluated. For the saved, Christ will assess our works at the Judgment Seat of Christ (Romans
                    14:10, 2 Corinthians 5:10) to determine rewards. He spoke of this often: "The Son of Man will come... and then
                    He will reward each according to his works" (Matthew 16:27). There are varying rewards (crowns, positions in
                    the kingdom see Luke 19:17, 1 Cor 3:12-15) for faithfulness. For the unsaved, their works (sins) are
                    evidence for condemnation at the Great White Throne (Rev. 20:12 "the dead were judged according to their
                    works"). God's judgment is perfectly just; no one will be treated unfairly. The phrase also emphasizes
                    individual responsibility - "each one" will answer for their life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jesus bringing the reward "with Him" suggests immediacy. When He appears, judgment and reward follow
                    swiftly. This reminds believers to live in such a way that when Christ returns, He can say "Well done, good and
                    faithful servant" (Matthew 25:21). It reminds unbelievers that their accumulated deeds (and guilt) will
                    accompany them to judgment unless they repent.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Theological Note: The concept of judgment according to works is not contrary to salvation by grace. For
                    believers, good works are the fruit of genuine salvation, and God graciously rewards what His grace
                    enabled us to do <sup>37</sup>. For unbelievers, their works (and lack of Christ's atonement) are the basis of their
                    guilt. So Christ's rewards are really two-sided: blessing for those justified by faith (whose works demonstrate
                    that faith), and punishment for those who in stubborn unbelief continued in evil works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    William Kelly commented that in verse 12 Jesus is referring not to the blessing of those who keep the
                    prophecy (that was verse 7's focus), but now "for those whom He shall find here below, to render to each as his
                    work $is^{\prime\prime}$ <sup>38</sup>. This likely points to the scenario of His return affecting those alive on earth at His Second
                    Coming (e.g., separating sheep and goats, rewarding Tribulation saints vs. punishing beast worshipers). But
                    by extension it covers all judgment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: This verse motivates us to faithful service and holy living. Knowing Jesus will evaluate our
                    lives should instill a healthy reverence. We want to have works that please Him - works that will survive the
                    fire of judgment (1 Cor. 3:13). This means investing in eternal things: obedience, love, sharing the gospel,
                    helping others, etc., rather than living selfishly. Also, if wrongs have been done to us, we can find solace
                    that Jesus brings justice. He will reward the righteous and right all wrongs. We don't need to seek
                    vengeance; the Lord will repay (Romans 12:19). Another personal application: sometimes believers feel their
                    labors are unnoticed - but Jesus is bringing your reward. "God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of
                    love" (Hebrews 6:10). Even a cup of cold water given in Christ's name will not lose its reward (Matthew 10:42).
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the flip side, this should terrify the unrepentant: every lie, every cruelty, every secret sin is known and
                    there will be a "reward" (penalty) for it unless forgiven in Christ. It's an impetus to run to Jesus now for
                    mercy rather than face Him then with only justice. In summary, live every day with the expectation: "My
                    Lord is coming with rewards in hand." That will help prioritize our choices. Like Paul, we want to love His
                    appearing (2 Tim 4:8) and thus receive a crown, instead of shrinking back in shame (1 John 2:28).

                <h3>Verse 13: "I Am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last"</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End, the First and the Last." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Still the words of Jesus (from verse 12 context), He now identifies Himself with three profound titles, all of
                    which express His eternal divine nature:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Alpha and Omega" - Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet, Omega the last. This title was
                        used of God in Revelation 1:8 and 21:6, and of Christ in Revelation 1:11 (depending on manuscript)
                        and here. It means Jesus is the A to Z, the source and consummation of all things. He encompasses
                        all knowledge and existence. Nothing comes before Him or after Him. It implies His eternity and
                        omnipotence - He initiates creation and He brings it to its final purpose. In other words, Jesus is the
                        eternal Word (compare John 1:1) who spoke the first word in creation and will have the last word in
                        judgment and new creation.</li>
                    <li>"The Beginning and the End" A similar concept, also attributed to God in 21:6. Christ is the
                        beginning (Greek arche), meaning not just first in sequence but the source/origin. "All things were
                        made through Him" (John 1:3). And He is the end (Greek telos) the goal or consummation. All
                        history is moving toward the glory of Christ. Colossians 1:16 echoes this: "All things were created
                        through Him and for Him." So Christ is the beginning (creator) and the end (the one for whom all
                        exists and who will conclude the story). This title assures us of Christ's sovereignty over time and
                        history.</li>
                    <li>"The First and the Last" - This title is explicitly used by Jesus earlier in Revelation 1:17 and 2:8, and
                        significantly it's a title Yahweh uses in Isaiah 44:6 ("I am the First and I am the Last; besides Me there is
                        no God") and Isaiah 48:12. By taking this title, Jesus unmistakably claims full deity He is one with
                        the God of Israel. The "First" (protos) and "Last" (eschatos) again signify eternity and supremacy.
                        There was none before Him and none after - He spans all of existence. It also can imply that He is
                        the ultimate cause and conclusion - similar to alpha/omega.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    All three phrases essentially reinforce each other; the triple form adds emphasis. The repetition of similar
                    ideas in different words is a Hebrew style of expressing completeness and certainty. Jesus wants us to know
                    exactly who He is: the eternal, all-encompassing God. This is especially fitting as He is giving final words - He
                    speaks as the One who has authority over the entire scope of redemptive history. It underscores the
                    reliability of His promise to come quickly and reward - because He is God from start to finish. Who else
                    could guarantee the outcome of history except the One who began it and will end it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    For believers, these titles bring great comfort: Our Lord Jesus isn't just a part of the story - He is the story.
                    He's writing it from Genesis to Revelation. If He is the Beginning and End, then nothing in between is
                    outside His control. If He is the First and Last, then our lives are safe in His eternal hands. It also
                    encourages us to worship Christ as fully God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    John Darby commented on this verse, noting that Christ here "announces Himself, having taken up the
                    word in Person... as Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end God before and after all; and filling
                    duration" <sup>39</sup>. In other words, Jesus spans all of time and existence, from eternity past to eternity future. We
                    find our meaning in relation to Him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: How do we respond to such a revelation of Christ's identity? Firstly, with worship and awe.
                    When we pray or sing to Jesus, remember you're addressing the Alpha and Omega very God of very God.
                    This should deepen our reverence and trust. Secondly, these truths can banish fear. If Jesus is the Beginning
                    and End, then no circumstance is outside His plan. We can say, "Lord, You are in control from start to finish; I
                    trust You with both my birth and death and everything in between." It also humbles us: we are not the center;
                    He is. Our lives find purpose only as they align with the One who is the beginning and end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, it gives hope: The one who began a good work in us will complete it (Philippians 1:6) - because
                    He is the Completer. The world's chaos doesn't have the last word - Jesus does. In personal trials or when we
                    see evil in society, recall that Christ is the Last - He will have the final say, and it will be just and good.
                    When sharing Christ with others, we can confidently present Him not merely as a historical figure but as the
                    eternal God: "the First and Last" who calls them into a relationship.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, ponder that our Savior who died for us is none other than the Alpha and Omega - meaning His
                    sacrifice has infinite value and His love is from everlasting to everlasting. Such thoughts fuel deep devotion.
                    Let's echo Thomas: "My Lord and my God!" (John 20:28). Jesus is everything the A to Z. Therefore, He
                    deserves everything from us: all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 14: Blessing on Those Who Obey (Wash Their Robes/Do His Commandments) - Access to the Tree of Life</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"Blessed are those who do His commandments, that they may have the right to the tree of life, and
                    may enter through the gates into the city." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here we encounter another beatitude (blessed saying). However, there is a well-known textual variation in
                    this verse. The NKJV (following the Majority Text/TR) reads "those who do His commandments", whereas many
                    modern versions (ESV, NIV) read "those who wash their robes". The difference comes from a variation in
                    Greek manuscripts - but both phrases convey complementary truths. We'll consider NKJV's reading first:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Blessed are those who do His commandments." This phrase points to the importance of
                        obedience. It echoes Jesus' words in John 14:15, "If you love Me, keep My commandments." In
                        Revelation's context, it may especially refer to heeding the calls to faithfulness given throughout the
                        book (e.g., resisting the beast, keeping oneself pure, holding to Jesus' testimony). Those who "do His
                        commandments" are essentially true believers, since obedience is the fruit of saving faith (1 John
                        2:3-4). They are "blessed" - happy and fortunate - because their obedient faith grants them access to
                        the eternal blessings described next. Obedience does not earn salvation, but it is evidence of it, and
                        thus gives "right" in the sense of proving one's part in Christ.</li>
                    <li>The alternate reading "Blessed are those who wash their robes" (found in older manuscripts)
                        emphasizes cleansing by the blood of Christ. Revelation 7:14 uses that phrase: "they have washed
                        their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb." If that is the original reading, the meaning
                        is: Blessed are those who have been cleansed from their sins by Christ's sacrifice. Essentially,
                        those who have appropriated Christ's atonement are blessed. This also leads to the same result: only
                        the forgiven, blood-washed saints may enter the Holy City.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Interestingly, both readings are theologically harmonious - those who have been washed in the blood
                    will also be those who keep God's commandments (not perfectly, but as a direction of life). Our
                    obedience flows from being cleansed and regenerated. Darby, in fact, preferred "wash their robes" as the
                    true text <sup>40</sup>, underscoring grace. But he and others acknowledged that the evidence of washed robes is a
                    life of holiness (obedience).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The verse continues: "that they may have the right to the tree of life, and may enter through the gates
                    into the city." Here is the reward of being among the blessed, redeemed ones: access to the tree of life
                    (see verse 2) and free entrance into New Jerusalem. "Right" to the tree of life implies entitlement or authority.
                    In Christ, believers have the God-given right to eternal life (symbolized by eating from the tree). This
                    reverses the banishment of Adam. What man lost by disobedience, Christ regained for us by His obedience.
                    Early in Revelation, a promise to overcomers was "To him who overcomes I will give to eat from the tree of life,
                    which is in the midst of the Paradise of God" (Rev. 2:7). Here we see its fulfillment. We will freely enjoy eternal
                    sustenance and immortality with God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Likewise, entering the city's gates means we are full citizens of God's kingdom. We belong there. In
                    ancient times, only approved citizens or dignitaries could enter a walled city's gates freely. Sinners and
                    outsiders might be kept out. By saying we can "enter by the gates," it implies a welcome we're not
                    sneaking in or barred at the door. Jesus said in John 10:9, "I am the door. If anyone enters by Me, he will be
                    saved, and will go in and out and find pasture." Through Christ (the Door), we legitimately enter God's city. We
                    have eternal security and fellowship (coming and going at will in God's presence, though really we will
                    dwell there continually).
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, verse 14 essentially summarizes the beatific state of the redeemed: cleansed by Christ (and evidenced
                    by obedience), thus granted eternal life and citizenship in heaven. It's the ultimate blessing - the fulfillment of
                    all our hopes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: This verse invites us first to make sure we are among those "washed" and obedient. Have
                    you had your robes washed in Jesus' blood? That happens when one repents and trusts Christ, receiving His
                    forgiveness. If not, you're missing the right to the tree of life. If yes, then you are blessed - rejoice! But also,
                    do you "do His commandments"? Our lifestyle should match our claim of being washed. This is a check: Am I
                    living in a way that befits someone headed for the Holy City? Ephesians 5:8 says, "You were once darkness, but
                    now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Knowing what awaits (tree of life, entry to the city) should motivate us to persevere in purity. No
                    temporary pleasure of sin is worth forfeiting that right (not that true salvation can be lost, but a pattern of
                    willful disobedience might indicate one was never truly washed). Also, this beatitude gives comfort about
                    loved ones who died in Christ: if they had washed robes and faithful lives, they now have the right to the
                    tree of life and walk Heaven's streets. We grieve with hope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, verse 14 stirs evangelism in us. We desire that more people "wash their robes" in Jesus' blood and
                    gain access to the city. It's heartbreaking to think some will be left outside (as next verse shows). So we
                    invite others to the cleansing fountain (Zechariah 13:1). There's a popular hymn line: "Blessed are they who
                    do His commandments, they shall claim the tree of life." Let's live out that blessed obedience and share
                    the invitation so that many will join us inside the gates, eating the fruit of eternal life together.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 15: The Exclusion of the Wicked</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever
                    loves and practices a lie." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In contrast to the blessed insiders of verse 14, verse 15 lists those who are excluded ("outside") from the
                    Holy City. This stark contrast reinforces the holiness of the New Jerusalem and the necessity of being among
                    the redeemed to enter it. "Outside" doesn't necessarily mean just outside the city walls on the new earth (for
                    in the eternal state, all evil is confined to the lake of fire - Rev. 20:15). It rather means excluded from the city
                    - i.e., excluded from eternal life and God's presence, hence consigned to hell (the second death). Revelation
                    21:8 gave a similar list of those whose part is in the lake of fire, and 21:27 said nothing impure can enter the
                    city. So verse 15 reiterates that no unrepentant sinner will inherit the kingdom of God (see also 1
                    Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21).
                </p>
                <p>
                    The list of the excluded: "Dogs" - In biblical usage, "dogs" were a derogatory term. To Jews, dogs were
                    unclean scavengers. In the New Testament, "dogs" can refer to impure or shameless people (Philippians 3:2
                    "Beware of dogs" referring to false teachers of the circumcision party). In ancient culture, it might also
                    allude to male cult prostitutes (Deuteronomy 23:18 uses "dog" figuratively for such). Here, it likely means
                    those of vile, morally impure character <sup>41</sup>. They live like unclean animals, driven by base instincts, not by
                    God's Spirit. It's a strong term for the despicable (from a holy perspective). "Sorcerers" - those who
                    practice magic arts and occultism (the Greek word pharmakoi hints at using potions/drugs in witchcraft).
                    Sorcery in Revelation is associated with deception and demonism (Rev. 18:23). Thus, all forms of witchcraft,
                    occult practices, or drug-induced superstition fall here. These are rejected because they follow demonic
                    powers rather than God. - "Sexually immoral" - the Greek pornos refers to fornicators, those engaging in
                    sexual sin (any sexual activity outside God's design of marriage between a man and woman). This covers
                    adultery, premarital sex, homosexuality, etc., unrepented. The holy city has no place for the unholy use of
                    God's gift of sexuality. "Murderers" - those who take life unjustly, from hatred or violence. In a broader
                    sense, it includes those who harbor hatred (1 John 3:15 equates hatred with murder in God's eyes). The city
                    of life has no place for those who embraced death-dealing ways. "Idolaters" those who worship
                    anything other than the true God (could be literal idols, money, power, etc.). In Revelation's original context,
                    this would include worshipers of the beast or emperor. Idolatry violates the first commandment. Only those
                    who worship God the Lamb are inside; all who gave their devotion elsewhere are excluded. - "Whoever
                    loves and practices a lie"
                    This covers all kinds of deceivers, especially those who love falsehood. It
                    hearkens to the ultimate lie of Satan. In Revelation, the "lie" might specifically relate to false religion or
                    denying Christ (2 Thess. 2:10-11 speaks of people believing "the lie" of the Antichrist). But it includes all
                    habitual liars and those who find pleasure in deception. Earlier in 21:8, "all liars" were listed. God is truth;
                    nothing false can enter His city.

                    This catalogue basically spans major categories of sin: ritual impurity, occult sin, sexual sin, sins against
                    others, sins against God, sins of falsehood. It's not an exhaustive list but representative. These are people
                    whose lifestyles were characterized by such sins, showing they were never born again or cleansed by Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's implied that these "outsiders" are in the lake of fire, the only other place mentioned for the wicked after
                    judgment. So "outside" likely equals "in hell." Some commentators note the tragic image: while the saints
                    are feasting on the tree of life inside, the lost are eternally outside shut out from the feast, as Jesus'
                    parables describe (e.g., outer darkness, Matthew 22:13).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Important to note: In this life, some of us were exactly these things - Paul says "such were some of you; but
                    you were washed... sanctified... justified in the name of the Lord Jesus" (1 Cor. 6:11). So it's not that anyone who
                    ever committed these sins has no hope; rather, those who clung to these sins and refused Christ's
                    salvation remain defiled by them and thus cannot enter heaven. If a person truly repents and is cleansed
                    (like the "washed robes" imagery), they are no longer identified by these labels. But those who "loved" their
                    sin and persisted in practicing it showing they did not love God's truth are left "outside." It underscores
                    that God's judgment is just those in hell are there because they ultimately preferred darkness to light
                    (John 3:19).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: This verse should stir a holy fear and urgency in us. It's a sober reminder that sin excludes
                    from God's kingdom. We should examine ourselves: Do I "love" any lie? Do I harbor any idols? If any such
                    patterns linger, it calls for repentance. While believers can stumble into sins, they will not love and practice
                    them continually if they are truly regenerated conviction and discipline will lead them out. If someone
                    finds themselves loving sin more than God, they need to truly turn to Christ while there is time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For evangelism, verse 15 is basically telling us who is lost and needs the gospel: the immoral, the deceived,
                    the idolater, etc. It's a prompt to reach out even to those steeped in these sins, because only the gospel can
                    wash them. We shouldn't soft-pedal the reality of exclusion from heaven - sometimes people need to hear
                    that "no, not everyone goes to a better place; certain lifestyles lead you away from God." In love, we must warn
                    that outside is terrible, and only Jesus can bring one inside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, for believers suffering injustice or surrounded by evil, this verse comforts that none of those evils will
                    enter eternity with us. All the corrupt, violent, deceitful forces we struggle against now will be shut out. In
                    the here and now, the "dogs" and liars often barge into our lives; but in New Jerusalem, absolute purity and
                    safety reigns. So, endure a little longer - God will "outside" all evil permanently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, verse 15 is a mirror: if any of these descriptions fit someone reading, let it drive them to repentance.
                    If by grace we've been saved from these, let it cause gratitude and deep aversion to returning to that vomit.
                    It underscores what a high price Jesus paid, as these sins deserved exclusion but He was excluded on the
                    cross ("My God, why have You forsaken Me?") so that we could come in. Praise God for that grace!
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 16: "I, Jesus... the Root and Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star"</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches. I am the Root and the
                    Offspring of David, the Bright and Morning Star." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now Jesus Himself speaks in the first person (confirming it's been Him speaking in verses 12-15 too). He
                    gives a sort of divine signature and seal to the entire book.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify to you these things in the churches." This reminds us of
                        Revelation 1:1-2, where Jesus sent an angel to deliver the revelation to John. By saying "I, Jesus," He
                        personalizes and authenticates the message. It's as if He is signing the letter with His own name
                        "Jesus." This is one of the few places in Scripture where the Lord refers to Himself by His human
                        name "Jesus" directly to us, highlighting His personal connection to His Church. He wants us to know
                        He Himself is behind this book. The angel was just His messenger.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The phrase "to testify to you these things in the churches" indicates the audience. Unlike many prophecies
                    given only to individuals or Israel, this prophecy is intended for the churches i.e., the Christian
                    congregations (like the seven churches of Asia Minor and by extension all churches). This loops back to the
                    letters to seven churches in chapters 2-3. Revelation as a whole is meant to be read publicly and heeded in
                    church gatherings. It's not an arcane document for a select few; it's the Church's book of hope and warning.
                    Jesus cares that His assembled people know what's coming. So this verse dispels any notion that Revelation is
                    too impractical or scary for regular church folk - Jesus specifically addressed it "to the churches." We who
                    are part of His Church must pay attention.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"I am the Root and the Offspring of David." Here Jesus identifies Himself with two connected but
                        distinct messianic titles relating to King David:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As Root of David, He is the source/origin of David. This implies His divinity and pre-existence. How
                            could Christ be the root (ancestor) of David? Only if He is David's Lord who existed before David.
                            Indeed, Isaiah 11:10 prophesied a "Root of Jesse" (David's father) who would reign. Jesus stumped
                            the Pharisees by asking how the Messiah could be David's Son if David calls Him "Lord" (Matthew
                            22:42-45). The answer: Messiah is both David's Creator (root) and his descendant.</li>
                        <li>As Offspring of David, He is literally a descendant of David in His human lineage (born from the line
                            of David through Mary, as the Gospels record). This affirms His humanity and rightful claim to the
                            Davidic throne as the promised Messiah-King. God promised David that his seed would reign
                            forever (2 Samuel 7:12-16). Jesus fulfills that: "the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David"
                            (Luke 1:32). He is born of David's line ("offspring" can be translated "shoot" or "branch" - see Isaiah
                            11:1, a branch from Jesse's roots).</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    By combining Root and Offspring, Jesus encapsulates His unique nature: both divine and human, the
                    eternal God who entered David's line as man. As William Kelly notes, Jesus here presents Himself in His
                    kingly connection to Israel's promises (Root and Offspring of David) <sup>42</sup>. This shows that the one speaking
                    and promising "I come quickly" is none other than Israel's Messiah, the fulfillment of covenant promises.
                    The early church, especially Jewish Christians, would resonate with this - knowing Jesus is truly the Messiah
                    of Israel.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The Bright and Morning Star." This title shifts focus to a different aspect. The morning star
                        appears in the sky just before dawn, while it's still night, heralding the coming day. Jesus being the
                        Bright Morning Star indicates:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>He is glorious ("bright").</li>
                        <li>He appears just before the dawn of the Kingdom (the Millennium or the eternal day).</li>
                        <li>This title was promised to believers in Revelation 2:28 ("I will give him the morning star" - essentially
                            giving them Himself).</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    In biblical typology, the "Sun of Righteousness" (Malachi 4:2) represents Christ's coming to Israel and the
                    world in visible power at the dawn of the Kingdom (the Second Coming, bright as the sun). The "Morning
                    Star" by contrast is seen only by those awake in the night, anticipating the day. Many commentators
                    (especially in dispensational circles) see "morning star" as a picture of Christ's coming for His Church (the
                    rapture), which occurs prior to the "dawn" of the visible kingdom <sup>43</sup> <sup>44</sup>. The Church, watching in the dark
                    night of the world, sees Christ as the Morning Star - our hope that He will call us home before the judgment
                    and kingdom dawn breaks upon the world. Darby eloquently wrote that the morning star doesn't awaken
                    the sleeping world but is a delight to those who watch through the night <sup>43</sup>. So Jesus as Morning Star is
                    especially a comfort to the Church: He's coming privately for us (at the rapture) ahead of His public coming
                    as the Sun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether or not one makes that timing distinction, Morning Star certainly indicates hope and comfort in
                    dark times. 2 Peter 1:19 says, "...until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts." That rising star
                    in our hearts is Christ's return anticipated now by faith. He is our light in the darkness, assuring us a new
                    day is near.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So in one breath, Jesus declares Himself the fulfillment of Jewish hope (Messiah son of David) and Church
                    hope (Morning Star). Both aspects are united in His person. We see here again the broad sweep of God's
                    plan - Jesus over Israel and the Church, over both prophecy and mystery.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Jesus saying "I, Jesus" is personal. It reminds us our faith is not in ideas but in a Person - the
                    living Jesus who speaks to us. He sent His angel, showing He actively cares that we get His message. So
                    when you read Revelation (or any Scripture), receive it as from Jesus Himself to you. It carries weight and
                    also love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His being Root and Offspring of David should strengthen our confidence in God's promises. Across
                    millennia, God kept His word to David by sending Jesus. He will also keep His word about Jesus' return.
                    Christ's credentials are solid. It also shows Christ's humility - the mighty Root of David chose to become also
                    David's Offspring for our sake. Marvel at the mystery: the Creator became a creature, God became man,
                    fulfilling every promise in between.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cherishing Jesus as the Morning Star can ignite joy. In the darkest night of our trials, look for the Morning
                    Star. He may not have risen for all to see yet, but by faith we see Him and know the night is far spent. This
                    can give you strength to endure: "just a little while, and He who is coming will come" (Hebrews 10:37). Also,
                    consider: the morning star is exceedingly beautiful to those awake early - do we rise early (figuratively) to
                    gaze on Jesus? This speaks to cultivating an eager, watchful heart. Those who love His appearing will be
                    rewarded (2 Tim. 4:8). Perhaps we should literally sometimes go out before dawn and see the morning star
                    (often Venus) and let it remind us: "Maybe today, Lord?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, "Bright Morning Star" implies we as Christians should reflect His light even now. Philippians 2:15
                    urges us to shine like lights (literally luminaries or stars) in this world. We reflect the Morning Star to others
                    by holding forth the word of life. Let's point people to Jesus in this dark world, so they too might have the
                    hope of dawn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In sum, verse 16 richly assures us that the book of Revelation is from Jesus - Messiah and Hope-Giver - so
                    we can stake our lives on it.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 17: The Invitation - "Come!"</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"And the Spirit and the bride say, 'Come!' And let him who hears say, 'Come!' And let him who thirsts
                    come. *Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This beautiful verse is like a grand double-invitation, with two directions of "Come!" being expressed:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>The Church's plea to Christ: "And the Spirit and the bride say, 'Come! "" - Here, the Holy Spirit and the
                        bride (the Church) unite in calling out for Jesus to return. In response to Jesus' promise "I am
                        coming quickly" (v.12, v.20), the Spirit in the hearts of believers moves us to cry, "Come, Lord Jesus!"
                        This is essentially a prayer for Christ's return - often summarized by the Aramaic word "Maranatha"
                        (1 Cor. 16:22). The bride is the Church portrayed as the bride of Christ (see Rev. 19:7). The bride longs
                        for the Bridegroom's appearing. Significantly, the Spirit also says "Come" - meaning the Holy Spirit,
                        dwelling in the Church, inspires and agrees with this longing. It's a Spirit-led desire of God's people
                        that Jesus should come and consummate the marriage, taking us to Himself (John 14:3).</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    William Kelly noted, "The church cannot hear of Him as the Morning Star without at once desiring that He should
                    come" <sup>45</sup>. The Spirit in us stirs an echo of Christ's own promise. So, our proper posture is one of yearning:
                    "We want You, Jesus!" It's notable that it doesn't say the bride says, "Come quickly." Kelly comments the
                    Church, in submission, simply says "Come," leaving the timing to Him <sup>46</sup>. But Jesus Himself adds "quickly" -
                    only He can speak to the timing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, "the Spirit and the bride" implies harmony between the Holy Spirit and the Church when the
                    Church is in tune with God. When we are filled with the Spirit, our cry aligns with God's will - and God's will
                    is that Christ returns and reigns. This prayer "Come" is a fitting summary of all Christian hope.
                </p>
                <ol start="2">
                    <li>The Church's invitation to the world: "And let him who hears say, 'Come!' And let him who thirsts come.
                        Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely." - Now the direction shifts. First, "him who hears"
                        presumably means whoever has heard the Spirit and bride's cry - i.e., the individual believer who has
                        heard the gospel. That person is invited to join the chorus: "say, Come!" (likely also directed to Jesus).
                        In other words, every believer, even if they feel they're not very knowledgeable ("he who hears"
                        maybe implies one who has just heard and believed), is encouraged to also long for Christ's return.
                        No Christian is too simple or unworthy to pray "Come, Lord Jesus." Make it your own cry.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Then, the invitation clearly goes outward: "And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water
                    of life freely." This is a final evangelistic invitation in the Bible. "Him who thirsts" refers to anyone who
                    recognizes their need for salvation spiritual thirst (as in Matthew 5:6, "hunger and thirst for
                    righteousness"). Isaiah 55:1 resonates: "Ho! Everyone who thirsts, come to the waters..." Jesus Himself cried in
                    John 7:37, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink." Here the bride, by the Spirit, extends that same
                    offer: Are you thirsty for forgiveness, for true life? Come!
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Whoever desires" (or "whosoever will") underlines the universality of the call. Anyone who wants salvation
                    is welcome. There is no predestined exclusion from the invitation - it's genuinely open to all who will come.
                    This counters any notion that the gospel is restricted - whosoever will may come!
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Let him take the water of life freely." The water of life again refers to eternal life in Christ (see verse 1, the
                    river of life). To "take... freely" means it's a gift - you cannot pay for it or earn it. The Greek word for "freely"
                    is dorean, meaning without cost. This echoes Revelation 21:6, "I will give of the fountain of the water of life
                    freely to him who thirsts." Salvation is by grace: Jesus paid the price, so we may take freely. The only condition
                    implied is desire (thirst/will). If one truly wants the living water, they are invited to take it. It reminds of
                    Jesus's encounter with the Samaritan woman: He offered her "living water" springing to eternal life (John
                    4:10-14). Here, at Scripture's end, the offer still stands - even intensified - right up until the final pages.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's profound that after pronouncing judgment on the wicked "outside" in verse 15, the very next verse says
                    effectively, "But you don't have to stay outside if you thirst, come in and drink!" Grace is still extended. This
                    shows God's heart: even at the threshold of closing the book, He pleads with sinners to come receive life.
                    It balances the warnings with mercy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, two "Comes": one is the bride to the Bridegroom, the other is the bride to the thirsty stranger. This is
                    the dual role of the Church - looking upward for Christ, and outward for the lost.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: First, does "Come, Lord Jesus" rise from your heart? Or have we lost our first love and become
                    too comfortable here? The Spirit within us yearns for Jesus we should nurture that desire. How? By
                    focusing on His promises, by worship and prayer that often include longing for His return, by living as
                    pilgrims. Titus 2:13 calls it "looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Savior."
                    Make "Come, Lord" part of your prayer vocabulary. It's a sign of spiritual health and love.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Second, are we echoing the invitation to the thirsty? This is evangelism. The Church (the bride) led by the
                    Spirit should be saying to the world, "Come to Jesus, and drink freely!" It's noteworthy that the bride's voice
                    here invites others - implying our role is to call others to salvation up until the very end. We must never
                    neglect the "whoever desires" part of the gospel. It's beautifully inclusive: everyone is welcome, regardless
                    of background or past sins, if they will only come. We should share the gospel as widely as possible,
                    knowing it's a genuine offer to all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, note the simplicity: take the water of life freely. Gospel presentations need not be complicated; it's an
                    offer to take what Christ offers, at no cost. Are we perhaps guilty of adding cost (like implying people must
                    clean up first or follow certain rituals)? The scripture says freely let's keep grace free. No works, no
                    payment - just come and drink.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For seekers: do you thirst? That's the only qualification. Thirst means recognizing your soul's need - that
                    money, pleasure, etc., haven't satisfied, that you are parched spiritually. If so, Jesus invites you. Don't
                    hesitate thinking you're not worthy - whoever desires may come. The water of life (eternal life) is a gift. You
                    take it by faith by believing in Jesus and receiving Him (John 1:12). As the hymn says, "Let him that is
                    athirst now come."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, verse 17 stands as one of the most grace-filled verses in Scripture. It's the Spirit's final wooing. If the
                    Bible ended with verse 15, we might despair for sinners; but verse 17 shows the door is still open now. One
                    day it will close, but as of this invitation, it hasn't. It's also a model for us: As we long for Christ's return, we
                    must at the same time be inviting others to Christ. Our end-time hope should not make us inward; it should
                    propel us outward to bring as many to the water as will come, before night falls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, Revelation's grand finale isn't just prophecy - it's pleading. The King is coming, and the Bride
                    says "Come!" while also shouting to the lost, "Come drink!" May we live in that dual attitude daily: "Even so,
                    come Lord Jesus!" and "Be reconciled to God- take the free gift of life!"
                </p>

                <h2>Revelation 22:18-21 - Warning, Promise, and Closing Benediction</h2>
                <p>
                    The final verses of the Bible contain a solemn warning against tampering with the sacred text (verses
                    18-19), followed by Jesus' final assurance of His imminent return (verse 20) and a concluding prayer/blessing
                    (verse 21). These words leave a lasting impression about the authority of Scripture, the certainty of Christ's
                    coming, and the grace of God with His people.
                </p>

                <h3>Verses 18-19: The Warning Against Adding or Removing Words</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds to these
                    things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from
                    the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the
                    holy city, and from the things which are written in this book." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    These verses deliver a direct and fearsome warning. John, as the inspired writer, testifies (solemnly
                    declares, almost in legal fashion) that absolutely no tampering with the contents of Revelation (and by
                    extension, Scripture as a whole) is permissible.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adding to the words of this prophecy will result in God adding to that person the plagues described
                        in Revelation. The plagues likely refer to the various judgments throughout the book (the seals,
                        trumpets, bowls, and the final lake of fire judgment) <sup>47</sup>. In other words, one who dares to insert
                        their own false "revelations" or distortions into this book will incur the full measure of God's wrath. It
                        implies such a person is aligning themselves with the false prophets (like those promoting the
                        worship of the beast) and thus will suffer those plagues. Throughout Scripture, adding to God's word
                        is condemned (Deuteronomy 4:2, Proverbs 30:5-6) <sup>34</sup>. It typically means introducing human ideas
                        as if divine or altering doctrine by addition (e.g., the Pharisees adding traditions). Here the stakes are
                        shown to be eternal.</li>
                    <li>Taking away from the words (subtracting, omitting parts) will result in God taking away that
                        person's share in the Book of Life, the holy city, and the other blessings written. This means loss of
                        eternal life exclusion from heaven (as only those in the Lamb's Book of Life enter the city, Rev.
                        21:27). In essence, it's damnation. Removing words suggests rejecting or denying parts of God's
                        revelation (like heretics who cut out truths they dislike). Marcion in early church, for example,
                        removed large parts of Scripture a spirit that persists today when people pick-and-choose
                        doctrines. God says such will lose everything - their name out of the Book of Life (meaning they are
                        not saved), no access to the city or any promise.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This warning is extremely strong. It does not mean a true believer could lose salvation by accidentally
                    misquoting a verse or having a variant manuscript. Rather, it addresses willful corruption of God's message.
                    It assumes an attitude of either arrogant deception (adding false teaching) or arrogant unbelief (denying
                    true teaching). Such actions reveal a person who is not truly regenerate, hence the threatened punishment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In context, think of those who might try to distort Revelation's message perhaps to fit a different
                    narrative, or claim more visions beyond it that alter its meaning (like some cults do). God is essentially
                    putting an official seal of canon here: This is My final revelation; don't tamper. Indeed, Revelation is the last
                    book chronologically and in placement adding any "new revelation" that changes the story is forbidden.
                    Likewise, taking out the uncomfortable parts (like judgment, hell, etc.) is forbidden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's interesting that the specific punishments mirror the crimes: add words -> receive added plagues.
                    Remove words -> lose blessings (removed from your account). It's perfect justice. The severity also
                    underscores that God's Word is sacred; to mess with it is to assault God's authority and truthfulness.
                    Essentially, it's aligning with Satan (who from Eden twisted God's word saying "has God indeed said...?").
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the warning explicitly refers to "the prophecy of this book" (Revelation), by principle it can extend to
                    all Scripture. The Bible began with a command not to eat of one tree (which Satan twisted) and ends with a
                    command not to alter God's words. We should approach Scripture with reverence, seeking to interpret
                    faithfully rather than bending it to our desires.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Practically, we might not physically cut out verses or add new ones, but we must guard against
                    subtle ways of adding or subtracting: Adding: e.g., insisting on man-made doctrines or extra-biblical
                    revelations as equal to Scripture, legalisms, "new truths" that are not in the Bible. We must hold the
                    completed canon as sufficient (Jude 3 says the faith was "once for all delivered"). Subtracting: e.g.,
                    ignoring doctrines that are unpopular (like judgment, sexual ethics, etc.), or explaining away miracles, or
                    claiming some biblical texts are not for today. We should preach and accept the whole counsel of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We should also be discerning of false teachers and groups that do exactly this - many cults have additional
                    "scriptures" or heavily edited Bibles. This verse should ring alarm bells regarding any movement that says
                    "we have another testament" or "here's a new prophecy that changes what Revelation says." The plagues
                    and loss of life threaten such behavior - God takes it seriously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On a personal level, it encourages humility under God's Word. We are not editors, we are messengers.
                    John himself as author doesn't claim the right to adjust what he's given - he passes it on intact and warns
                    others to do the same. The Bible is not a buffet where we take what we want and leave what we don't. It's
                    the authoritative Word of God.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One might ask: can a true Christian fall under this curse? A true Christian should heed the warning and
                    avoid these errors. Those who flagrantly distort the gospel (like prosperity preachers twisting promises,
                    etc.) or deny core truths - if unrepentant - show they may not be true believers. We should pray for any who
                    are mishandling Scripture to repent, lest they face this horrid fate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's also comforting in a sense: the truth of God is protected. No attack on Scripture will succeed
                    ultimately; God will vindicate His Word and punish those who assail it. For believers, we can trust our God
                    has given a complete and secure revelation we don't need "more." And we should treasure every word.
                    Perhaps memorize these verses as a constant guardrail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In summary, verses 18-19 finalize the canon with a thunderclap: Do not meddle with God's Word. As Proverbs
                    30:5-6 says, "Every word of God is pure... Do not add to His words, lest He rebuke you and you be found a liar." <sup>34</sup>
                    May we handle the Scripture with the utmost fidelity, neither embellishing nor truncating, but declaring it
                    as is, knowing our eternal lot aligns with our response to His Word.
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 20: Jesus' Final Promise and John's Response</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"He who testifies to these things says, 'Surely I am coming quickly.' Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!"
                    (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This penultimate verse of the Bible encapsulates the heart of Christian expectation.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"He who testifies to these things" refers to Jesus Christ, the faithful witness of all these revelations
                        (see Rev. 1:5 where Jesus is called the faithful witness). Jesus is the one who has been "testifying"
                        throughout Revelation (through His angel and directly). Now, as if to officially close His testimony, He
                        speaks one more time: "Surely, I am coming quickly." This is the third time in this chapter Jesus
                        declares His imminent return (see v.7 and v.12). The word "Surely" (sometimes translated "Yes" or
                        "Surely") adds emphasis and certainty. It's like Jesus saying, "Yes indeed, I am coming soon!" There is
                        a tone of final confirmation - no doubt should remain.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    "Quickly" again denotes the suddenness and near expectation of His return (as earlier discussed). Jesus
                    wants this to ring in our ears as we finish Scripture: He is coming and it could be at any time. It's a promise,
                    an assurance, and to the believer, a joyful guarantee.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus!" Now the response: John (and all believers by extension) replies.
                        "Amen" means "so be it" or "truly." John is basically affirming Jesus' statement: Amen, let it be so. Then
                        he adds his own Spirit-inspired plea: "Even so, come, Lord Jesus!" This is essentially the same cry as
                        "Come, Lord" we saw in verse 17, but directly addressed to Jesus by name ("Lord Jesus"). It's John's
                        personal echo to Christ's promise. Some translations render it "Come, Lord Jesus!" alone, which is
                        actually the prayer Maranatha in Aramaic.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This little prayer "Come, Lord Jesus" is the last recorded prayer in Scripture. It powerfully sums up the
                    longing of the Church across ages. Having seen the visions of Revelation - both the horrors of evil and the
                    glories to come - John's final desire is for Jesus Himself to come and fulfill all things. It is the appropriate
                    response to prophecy: not to be obsessed with the events themselves, but to yearn for the Person of Christ.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can sense the passion and love in John's voice. "Lord Jesus" - he addresses his beloved Master, whom he
                    knew on earth and now sees in glory. There's a yearning for reunion and the completion of Christ's
                    kingdom. Also, by calling Him "Lord," it expresses submission and recognition of Christ's authority to do as
                    He promised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This dialogue between Jesus and the Church forms a fitting conclusion. It shows communion: Jesus gives
                    His word, the Church responds in faith and desire. It assures us that Jesus hears our "Amen, come!" and
                    implicitly He will answer it by indeed coming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Historically, the early church did have this prayer in use. The Didache (an early Christian document) records
                    believers praying "May grace come and this world pass away. Hosanna to the God of David. If anyone is
                    holy, let him come; if not, let him repent. Maranatha. Amen." So "Maranatha" was a watchword. We should
                    make it ours too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: Do we truly echo John's "Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!" in our hearts? Sometimes Christians may
                    fear the Second Coming (maybe due to attachment to this life or fear of judgment). But John shows the
                    bride's true heart: longing for the Bridegroom. If we find ourselves not desiring His return, it's time to
                    refocus on eternal things and renew our first love. As we grow in love for Christ and weariness of this fallen.
                    world's sin, "Come, Lord Jesus" will become a more natural cry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also teaches us the power of praying God's promises back to Him. Jesus says "I am coming" - John
                    prays "Yes, come!" We too can pray Scripture: "Lord, you promised to come quickly; we pray You to fulfill that
                    promise! We are ready for You." It's a prayer God delights in because it aligns with His will.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the flip side, if someone cannot sincerely pray "Come, Lord Jesus" because they know they're not right
                    with God let that motivate them to get right (through repentance and faith). The whole book invites and
                    warns so that no one need shrink at His coming (1 John 2:28). There's still an opportunity (as long as one is
                    alive) to heed and be able to welcome Christ with joy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For a suffering or persecuted believer, "Come, Lord Jesus" is a prayer of hope and relief asking Jesus to
                    intervene and set things right. For all of us, it should be a daily attitude. Perhaps literally including it in our
                    prayers or even sighs, especially when we see tragedies and injustice: "Oh, come, Lord Jesus."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, note how personal this is: Lord Jesus. Our hope is not an event but a Person. We long for Jesus - His
                    presence, His vindication, His rule. That's the essence of heaven.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, as we live each day, verse 20 invites us to hold two things: Christ's promise ("I am coming quickly") and
                    our response ("Amen, come!"). These should be like the rhythm of our Christian life - promise and prayer,
                    promise and prayer. One day the promise will become sight, and the prayer answered.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In sum, verse 20 seals the revelation with the sweet assurance from Jesus and the ardent agreement of the
                    Church. The Bible could end no better than with the bright morning Star Himself speaking of His return,
                    and His beloved responding, "Yes, please come!"
                </p>

                <h3>Verse 21: Closing Benediction of Grace</h3>
                <p>
                    <span class="verse-number">"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen." (NKJV)</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final verse of Scripture is a brief benediction, calling upon the grace of the Lord Jesus to be with all the
                    saints (the readers).
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ" - Grace (Greek charis) refers to God's unmerited favor and
                        enabling power given to believers. It is fitting that the Bible ends with grace, as that has been the
                        theme of redemption from start to finish: we are saved by grace, kept by grace, and will be glorified
                        by grace. Specifically, it is the grace of our Lord Jesus - highlighting that every blessing and help
                        flows from Jesus. He is Lord (sovereign), yet He deals with us in grace (kindness and gift). This pairing
                        of "Lord" and "grace" encapsulates the Christian life: we serve a gracious Master.</li>
                    <li>"Be with you all." - This indicates the inclusive scope: all believers (in the churches addressed and
                        beyond). Some manuscripts omit "you all" or just have "with all," but the meaning is to cover all the
                        recipients of this word - ultimately, all of Christ's people. It assures us that as we await His return, His
                        grace is present with us. It's a prayer/wish and an apostolic blessing. John, as an apostle/elder,
                        imparts this blessing as he closes.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    We can also hear in this the pastoral heart: after delivering such intense prophecies, John commends his
                    readers to Jesus' grace, knowing they will need it to stay faithful and comforted in the in-between time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Amen." - The final word "Amen" means so be it or truly. It likely is John's final endorsement of this
                    blessing and everything prior. So the very last word of the Bible is "Amen," which is appropriate: it
                    affirms all that has been revealed. It's like signing "Truly" at the end of a document. It also implies
                    our agreement - when we read, we can say "Amen" in response, accepting the blessing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comparatively, the Old Testament ended in Malachi with a warning of a curse (Mal. 4:6) <sup>15</sup>, whereas the
                    New Testament ends with grace. This contrast highlights the difference between law and grace. Through
                    Jesus Christ, grace has the last word.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, note it says the grace of our Lord Jesus. John includes himself with the readers (our Lord). We share
                    one Lord, one grace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Application: This benediction isn't just a formality; it's something we can take to heart. We live under grace
                    until Jesus comes. The days ahead, we have His grace to rely on. Thus, we should be strong in grace (2 Tim.
                    2:1), not in ourselves. The grace that forgave our sins also empowers us to overcome, to endure
                    persecution, to do His will. Whatever Revelation's readers would face - be it trials of that time or prophetic
                    end-times events - the grace of the Lord would sustain the faithful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For us, if we feel weak or fearful reading Revelation's heavy prophecies, this last verse assures us: His grace
                    is with you. You are not left to do this alone. Christ's grace means His presence, favor, and help. It also
                    implies joy and peace, since grace often carries those.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We should also note John's emphasis on Jesus' grace. Even after seeing the glorified Christ and the
                    judgments, John's final thought is "our Lord Jesus Christ" - personal and gracious. Knowing His grace is with
                    us should stir gratitude and love. It's like He signs off the letter saying, "I'm with you always, even to the end
                    of the age" (Matt. 28:20) but phrased as grace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, the word "grace" encapsulates the gospel. It's a reminder that entry into all the blessings we've
                    studied (the city, the water of life, etc.) is purely by grace. So those reading who have not responded can
                    know the door is grace
                    and for those who have, it's our constant standing. We don't move on from grace;
                    we delve deeper into it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We can echo, "Amen!"
                    which means we affirm God's entire plan and promise, and we yearn for its
                    fulfillment. It's a note of faith and agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, the Scripture ends on a note of blessing and hope. The last image left is not doom, but grace with us,
                    until Jesus comes in glory. This encourages a positive outlook: no matter how dark the immediate future
                    might be (with tribulations prophesied), the final reality is grace and Jesus among His people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a reflection: The Bible's storyline - creation, fall, redemption, new creation - closes assuring us that the
                    Redeemer's grace accompanies us from now to forever. Our response is worshipful: "Amen."
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, in closing: - We have heard Jesus' vow: "Surely I come quickly." - We have answered: "Amen. Come, Lord
                    Jesus!" - And until that moment, we rest in "the grace of our Lord Jesus."
                </p>
                <p>
                    Amen and Amen.
                </p>
